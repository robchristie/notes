My goal is state of the art object detection and classification of small targets in very large satellite images (e.g. 50000x100000 pixels). Data available to me: I have thousands of PDF documents containing domain information about objects from these images e.g. annotated image chips and accompanying graphics and text. I've got around 30TB of example images, however, the objects of interest tend to be relatively rare e.g. there might be lots of cars in a satellite image, but they only make up a small percentage of the total pixels. Some object might be rare, even across images, e.g. only occurring in 1 in 100, or 1 in 1000 images. Additionally, all images have geocoding, time and sensor positioning data. It would be good to take advantage of this (assuming it can provide benefit), as I don't think I've ever seen it utilised in automated object detection and classification. I have a small number of labeled images, maybe 100 with about 30,000 labels. Compute resources: I have 128 80GB A100 GPU's (4 GPU's per node) that I can use. No particular time limit on how long I can run compute for, but would like at least initial results after at most 2 weeks. Some initial thoughts: I'd like to make use of the vast amount of unlabeled imagery and PDF domain specific information. I'd like to move away from the purely supervised learning approach I've used to date. e.g. Taking an imagenet pre-trained model like resnet50 with a MaskRCNN head and trying to fine tune on labelled domain data. This does yield good results, but I'm forever trying to broaden the distribution by adding training data to improve performance. This isn't scalable. Utilising foundational transformer models seems like a much better approach. The current approach also chooses a small number of target classes of interest, then attempts to detect and classify them whenever they occur in images. This locks you into choice of detector upfront. Adding classes is difficult, and requires reprocessing if you want to find things in old images. I wonder if there are approaches where you could efficiently store the image content (e.g. embeddings) given most of the image doesn't contain objects of interest, and define your objects of interest after the fact? If this is infeasible, or sub-optimal I'd still be open to a more traditional object detector approach.

Thanks for the detailed context. To tailor the best object detection and classification pipeline for your satellite imagery, could you clarify a few things:

1.  What types of objects are you most interested in detecting (e.g. vehicles, buildings, ships, rare infrastructure)?
    
2.  Are your PDF documents machine-readable, or do they contain scanned images of text and annotations?
    
3.  Are there specific geospatial or temporal patterns you'd like to leverage (e.g. object types more common in certain locations or seasons)?
    
4.  Would you prefer a system capable of few-shot or zero-shot object detection based on textual or visual queries?
    
5.  Are you interested in integrating multi-modal learning, combining text from PDFs with satellite images?
    

Once I have this information, I’ll get started on an in-depth research plan.

You asked:
----------

1\. Traditionally, I've been primarily interested in vehicles (ships and planes), but that's more down to the limitations of previous approaches (it was a lot of effort to label and train for specific targets). I'd certainly be interested in the ability to easily find new targets of interest e.g. "specific buildings that look like this", or describing rare objects (perhaps with text, or photographs). 2. The PDF documents are text based with embedded images that contain annotations e.g. maps, annotated satellite images, diagrams and photographs. I have a rudimentary extraction pipeline using pymupdf and gemma 27b to handle the images (gemma generates a text description of the image and extracts text). Any advice on a better way to prepare the PDF data would be appreciated. 3. Not particularly. It would ideally be very robust to detecting objects "out of distribution" e.g. ships being transported across land, or planes where they very rarely occur. 4. Zero shot would be excellent, but I'd be happy with few-shot if zero shot proves unreliable. The base use case still needs to be high probability of detection for common object types e.g. all ships and aircraft. 5. Yes - very interested.

Advanced Object Detection and Classification in Satellite Imagery Using Foundation Models

State-of-the-Art Small Object Detection in Gigapixel Satellite Images
=====================================================================

Introduction and Challenges
---------------------------

Detecting small, rare objects in **very large satellite images** (e.g. 50,000×100,000 pixels) is extremely challenging. Traditional supervised methods (e.g. fine-tuning an ImageNet-pretrained ResNet+Mask R-CNN) struggle to generalize beyond a fixed set of classes and require constant addition of new training data. Key challenges include:

*   **Gigapixel Image Size:** A single image may be billions of pixels, far exceeding typical CNN/transformer input sizes. Processing such imagery requires tiling or multi-scale strategies.
    
*   **Small Object Scale:** Targets like vehicles or buildings occupy only a few pixels to a few dozen pixels, making them hard to detect against complex backgrounds. They can be easily missed or confused with clutter.
    
*   **Rare Object Occurrence & Class Imbalance:** Some object types appear in only 1 out of 100 or 1000 images. Even common objects (cars, planes, ships) occupy a tiny fraction of pixels in an image. This sparsity means an **overwhelming background** dominates training, and models can quickly bias toward “no object” unless guided well.
    
*   **Limited Labeled Data:** You only have ~100 fully annotated images (~30,000 object instances) – not nearly enough to cover the variability of all object types and conditions.
    
*   **Abundant Unlabeled Data:** Conversely, you possess ~30 TB of unlabeled imagery. Leveraging this vast data via self-supervised or semi-supervised learning is crucial for success[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=computational%20resources%2C%20and%20improved%20model,object%20detection%2C%20and%20other%20applications). Recent surveys note that _self-supervised pre-training (contrastive learning, masked autoencoders, etc.) significantly boosts remote sensing object detection performance and robustness_[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=finds%20that%20pre,object%20detection%2C%20and%20other%20applications).
    
*   **Geo-Temporal Metadata:** Each image comes with geolocation, acquisition time, and sensor parameters. These could provide context (e.g. certain objects only in specific regions or times), though such metadata is rarely used in current detection models. Incorporating it without overfitting remains an open question.
    
*   **Evolving or Open Set of Target Classes:** You ultimately want the flexibility to detect **new object categories on the fly** – e.g. find “buildings that look like _this_” or a rare object described in text – without having to retrain a dedicated detector for each new class. This calls for an _open-vocabulary_ or _post-hoc query_ approach rather than a closed-set classifier.
    

In summary, the task demands a solution that can **learn from limited labels + abundant unlabeled data**, handle **gigapixel images and tiny objects**, exploit **textual domain knowledge**, and allow **flexible, future class definitions** (zero-shot or few-shot detection). Below we outline a comprehensive strategy leveraging **foundation models** and modern techniques to meet these requirements.

Leveraging Unlabeled Images with Foundation Models
--------------------------------------------------

Given the massive unlabeled image collection (30 TB), a top priority is to train or fine-tune a **foundation model** on this data. Foundation models – large-scale pretrained models – have revolutionized remote sensing by providing general features that transfer well to tasks like detection[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=sensing%20has%20been%20significantly%20enhanced,achieved%20by%20those%20foundation%20models)[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=computational%20resources%2C%20and%20improved%20model,object%20detection%2C%20and%20other%20applications). We propose:

*   **Self-Supervised Pretraining:** Use methods such as contrastive learning or masked image modeling on countless image _tiles_ cropped from your 30 TB archive. For example, approaches like **SimCLR/MoCo/SwAV** (contrastive) or **MAE/BEiT** (masked autoencoders) can learn robust feature representations without labels. In remote sensing, self-supervised pretraining (e.g. Seasonal Contrast (SeCo), DINO, SatMAE) has shown big gains in detection performance[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=computational%20resources%2C%20and%20improved%20model,object%20detection%2C%20and%20other%20applications)[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=On%20the%20DOTA%20dataset%2C%20RVSA,for%20specific%20remote%20sensing%20applications). A survey reports foundation models achieving **80%+ mAP** on benchmarks like DOTA (large-scale object detection dataset) after self-supervised pretraining[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=On%20the%20DOTA%20dataset%2C%20RVSA,the%20best%20possible%20performance%20for) – far better than training from scratch. The learned backbone will serve as a strong feature extractor for small objects.
    
*   **Transformer Backbones:** Modern vision transformers (ViT, Swin Transformer) or hybrid CNN-Transformers are preferred as they handle long-range context well. Transformers have proven effective in remote sensing by modeling large receptive fields[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=Transformers%2C%20originally%20designed%20for%20natural,proposed%20by%20Vaswani%20et%20al). Many recent remote-sensing foundation models use ViT or Swin backbones[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=ResNet,B)[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=%5B40%20%5D%20Levir,B%20SSL%2025.6M%2F87.8M). With 128 A100 GPUs, you can afford to train a hefty model (even ViT-Large or Swin-L) on millions of image patches.
    
*   **Tiling and Multi-Scale Training:** Since you cannot feed a 50k×100k image at full resolution into a model, implement a tiling strategy. For pretraining, randomly sample smaller sub-images (e.g. 512×512 or 1024×1024 pixels) across the dataset. Use aggressive data augmentation (random crops, rotations, etc.) to expose the model to varied scales and orientations of objects. You might also incorporate a multi-scale pyramid in the model (like an FPN or ViT with patch sizes) so that objects of different sizes can be detected.
    
*   **Geospatial Metadata Integration:** While pretraining, one idea is to concatenate metadata (location coordinates, timestamp, sensor ID) into the input. For instance, encode lat/long as sine/cosine features or a learned embedding, and append it to the image token sequence or into the model’s late layers. This could allow the model to learn correlations like _ships more likely near coasts_. However, this should be done carefully – the model must still detect _ships anywhere_ if they appear out-of-distribution. There is little literature on using geo-tags in detectors; most foundation models stick to imagery alone. One notable example is **GeoKR** which injected geographic knowledge into ResNet features[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=Geographic%20Coverage%20Visual%20Encoder%20Pretrain,5M%20%202022%20Jul), but generally the gains from metadata are not well-explored. You can treat this as an experimental addition: perhaps start without it, then compare if adding a “metadata branch” improves precision on rare cases.
    

By the end of this stage, you would have a **strong, domain-specific visual backbone** (a pretrained transformer) that knows how to represent satellite imagery features. This backbone can be used for downstream detection and should be much more robust than ImageNet features for your task. For example, a foundation model “RVSA” (ResNet+ViT trained on remote images) achieved **81.2% mAP** on DOTA detection[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=On%20the%20DOTA%20dataset%2C%20RVSA,the%20best%20possible%20performance%20for), whereas earlier methods without such pretraining were substantially lower. The rich feature representations from self-supervised learning will help discriminate tiny objects from clutter.

Utilizing Domain Knowledge from PDF Documents
---------------------------------------------

You have thousands of PDF documents containing annotated image chips, maps, and text descriptions – a treasure trove of _domain-specific knowledge_. We should **harness the multimodal (image + text) information** in these PDFs to guide the model. Possible steps:

*   **Image-Text Pair Extraction:** Develop a pipeline to extract each figure or image from the PDFs along with any corresponding caption or descriptive text in the document. Your current approach with PyMuPDF + Google Gemma-27B (multimodal model) is a good start. To improve it, ensure you capture: (a) the raw image (satellite chip or diagram), (b) any caption below the image, and (c) any call-outs or labels on the image (via OCR if text is embedded in the image). It might help to use a PDF-specific tool that preserves layout, so you can associate captions like “Figure 3: \[description\]…” with the right image. If the PDFs have annotated maps (e.g. red circles around objects), consider if those annotations can be parsed (some PDFs might have vector drawing layers). If not, you could even apply an object detector to the extracted figure to find the marked objects (since those figures are smaller, this is feasible).
    
*   **Build a Remote Sensing “CLIP” dataset:** Using the extracted image-text pairs, you can create a dataset for **vision-language pretraining**. Each image chip from the PDF, paired with its description or the surrounding text, becomes a training sample. Even if you only get on the order of 10k–100k such pairs, they carry highly relevant semantics (e.g. “a missile launcher hiding under camouflage netting in a desert”). This can be used to _fine-tune a CLIP model_ or similar on your domain. Recent work shows that adapting CLIP to remote sensing yields huge benefits for zero-shot recognition. For instance, **RS-CLIP**, a CLIP model trained on remote sensing image-text data, achieved up to **95% accuracy in zero-shot scene classification**, vastly outperforming the original CLIP on that domain[centaur.reading.ac.uk](https://centaur.reading.ac.uk/119820/#:~:text=CentAUR%20centaur,21%2C). In your case, a domain-tuned CLIP will learn the language of your PDFs – linking phrases to satellite imagery patterns.
    
*   **Vision-Language Model Integration:** Once you have a domain CLIP (or a similar vision-language model), incorporate it into the detection pipeline (detailed next). The simplest use-case is **search and retrieval**: you could embed all your imagery (or candidate object patches) into CLIP’s visual embedding space, and embed a text query (e.g. _“small building with a dome roof”_) into the text space – the model can then find image regions with high similarity to the query. This directly enables _zero-shot object search_ over your image archive. Indeed, open-vocabulary detection methods often rely on CLIP embeddings to classify proposals by comparing image vs. text features in a shared space[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2311.11646#:~:text=on%20massive%20image,transfers%20knowledge%20from%20a%20pre). Keep in mind the finding by Bou _et al._ (2024) that a generic CLIP may lack fine-grained remote sensing vocabulary, whereas purely visual features like DINOv2 performed better on satellite object detection[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05381#:~:text=containing%20challenging%20and%20rare%20objects,datasets%2C%20despite%20minimal%20training%20parameters). **Solution:** use the PDF text to teach the model domain-specific vocabulary (class names and traits). By training CLIP on your data (or at least fine-tuning it), the text encoder will learn terms like _“SAM site”_, _“mobile launcher”_, _“dry dock”_, etc., which don’t appear often in ordinary CLIP training. This will narrow the gap so that text embeddings truly reflect your target objects.
    
*   **Multimodal Prototype Learning:** Another way to use text is as _“prototypes”_ for classes. Research on few-shot detection in remote sensing suggests combining **textual descriptions with visual exemplars** yields the best results[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/24/4693#:~:text=detection%2C%20constructing%20class%20prototypes%20from,both%20worlds%2C%20we%20propose%20a)[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/24/4693#:~:text=textual%20class%20names%20are%20processed,modal). Intuitively, a text embedding (from a language model like BERT or CLIP’s text tower) carries high-level semantic knowledge (e.g. a “ship” is a watercraft, usually in water, etc.), while a visual embedding of a few example chips carries specific appearance details. Liu _et al._ (2024) fuse textual and visual prototypes to create multi-modal class representations, and report up to **+8.7% AP50 improvement** in few-shot object detection performance[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/24/4693#:~:text=prototype%20aggregating%20module%20to%20integrate,remote%20sensing%20scenarios%20remains%20unexplored)[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/24/4693#:~:text=Figure%202,art%20approaches). We can adopt a similar idea: for any new target class, define it by a textual description _and_ (if available) a few image examples. The detector’s classifier can then be a _matching function_ that checks a region’s feature against these multi-modal class prototypes. This approach is more flexible than a fixed linear classifier and naturally extends to new classes without retraining the entire model.
    

In summary, the PDF-derived data allows us to imbue the model with **contextual and semantic knowledge** beyond what raw pixels provide. It’s like having an expert guide the model: the text can describe _how to recognize a rare object_, and the image chips provide exemplars. We will leverage this in building an **open-vocabulary detection system** below.

Open-Vocabulary Detection and Classification
--------------------------------------------

Instead of training a conventional detector locked to N predefined classes, we recommend an **open-vocabulary object detection (OVD)** approach. This means the detector can potentially detect _any object category_, given a suitable description or example of that category – addressing your need to add new classes without reprocessing all images. There are a few components to achieve this:

*   **Region Proposal Network (RPN) or Segmenter:** First, we need to generate candidate regions in the large image that _might contain any object_. These proposals should be _class-agnostic_. Traditional detectors use either sliding-window anchors or learned RPNs that are trained on known objects. For open-vocab, we can still train an RPN on the base classes (like vehicles) just to get it to propose regions that _look “objecty”_ in general. Alternatively, we can use a powerful pretrained segmenter like **SAM (Segment Anything Model)** to propose masks for **all objects** in an image. SAM, when given an image, can generate ~everything that looks like a discrete object or part in that scene. It has been shown to work on satellite images as well. The idea would be: run SAM (or an RPN) on each image tile to generate a set of candidate object bounding boxes or masks (this can be done offline and stored if needed). This addresses finding the needles in the haystack (small objects in huge images) without yet knowing what they are.
    
*   **Feature Extraction for Proposals:** For each candidate region, extract a feature descriptor using our **foundation backbone** (the one pretrained on 30TB of imagery). This could be, for example, a ViT feature vector from that region (or a RoI pooled feature from a CNN). Because the backbone was trained on diverse data, these features will encode the object’s visual appearance in a rich way.
    
*   **Open-Vocabulary Classification:** Now, instead of a fixed classifier head, classify a region by comparing its feature to **embeddings of class names or descriptions**. This is where the domain **CLIP** model (or a text encoder) comes in. We obtain a text embedding for each class of interest (e.g. the word “aircraft”, or a phrase “small propeller airplane”). The region is assigned the class whose text embedding is most similar to the region’s visual embedding (via cosine similarity)[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2311.11646#:~:text=on%20massive%20image,transfers%20knowledge%20from%20a%20pre). This effectively lets us have _thousands of potential classes_ without training a separate neuron for each – we just compute their text embeddings. If you have example images of a new class rather than a name, you can also embed those through the vision encoder and use them as “visual class prototypes” in the same embedding space. Recent open-vocab detectors follow this paradigm. For example, **ViLD (Viision-Language Detection)** by Google used a CLIP image encoder to embed region proposals and a CLIP text encoder for class names, matching them in a shared space[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2311.11646#:~:text=on%20massive%20image,transfers%20knowledge%20from%20a%20pre). Microsoft’s **GLIP** went further by _jointly training_ a detector on detection data _plus_ image-caption pairs, so it learned to align detection with text descriptions directly[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2311.11646#:~:text=vocabularies%20than%20conventional%20nature%20image,class%20similarity%20and). In your case, we can fine-tune such a model on your data (using your 100 labeled images for supervision on base classes like ships/planes, while also exposing it to image-text pairs from the PDFs to teach the alignment). The result will be a detector that can take a **text query at inference (“find building with a dome”)** and output boxes where such objects are present.
    
*   **Student-Teacher Self-Training:** Since you have so much unlabeled data, we should also exploit _pseudo-labeling_ to expand to novel classes. A cutting-edge approach, **CastDet (ECCV 2024)**, did exactly this for aerial images: it used a CLIP-based teacher to propose and label new objects in unlabeled images, and a student detector to learn from those pseudo-labels[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11646#:~:text=performance%20of%20OVD%20greatly%20relies,We%20conduct%20extensive)[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2311.11646#:~:text=pseudo,extensive%20experiments%20on%20multiple%20existing). Essentially, the CLIP model can score proposals for any class via the text embeddings – we take high-confidence detections on unlabeled images as new “labels” and retrain/refine the detector. This iterative self-training can discover **rare objects** that were not in the original 100 labeled images. CastDet reported a **large improvement (≈+21 mAP)** on novel object detection in aerial scenes by using a CLIP teacher in this way[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11646#:~:text=up%20for%20the%20OVD%20task,available%20at%20this%20https%20URL). You could employ a similar strategy: use your domain-CLIP as a teacher to tag occurrences of, say, a **new vehicle type** across the unlabeled dataset, then incorporate those as additional training data. Over time, the model’s vocabulary of detectable objects grows, without explicit human labeling.
    

_Open-vocabulary detection concept: Instead of fixed-class prediction, the detector compares proposal features with text or image embeddings. (Left) A traditional CLIP-based OVD uses CLIP as a frozen teacher to classify proposals; (Right) a hybrid approach injects CLIP knowledge into a student–teacher detection model for learning new classes[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2311.11646#:~:text=Image%3A%20Refer%20to%20caption%20Figure,an%20external%20knowledge%20source%20to)._

The above figure illustrates how we can integrate a CLIP-like model into the training process. In our implementation, the “teacher” could be the domain-adapted CLIP (trained on PDF data) that guides the detector to high-quality proposals and provides semantic labels for them[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2311.11646#:~:text=pseudo,extensive%20experiments%20on%20multiple%20existing). The “student” is our main detector that we train end-to-end. This way, the **broad knowledge in CLIP (about many object types)** is distilled into the detector. By the end, you should have a model that detects **common objects with high precision** (thanks to supervised training on those 30k labels) and can also **localize unseen objects** given a description or few examples (thanks to the open-vocab design and CLIP’s knowledge).

A few additional notes on making this work:

*   **Thresholding and Calibration:** In zero-shot settings, false positives can be an issue (the model might see _“objects”_ everywhere for a vague query). You will need to calibrate similarity score thresholds for detection. One trick is to always include a “background” or “none of the above” category embedding in the comparison – for example, an embedding of the word “background” or an average of many random image embeddings – to represent no-object. The detector should only output a box if its similarity to a real class exceeds similarity to “background” by a margin. This was used in some OVD methods to reduce false alarms.
    
*   **Few-Shot Fine-tuning:** If zero-shot detection of a new class is not sufficiently accurate, the framework easily supports a _few-shot fine-tune_. Because the backbone is strong and the classifier is based on embeddings, training on say 10–20 labeled examples of the new class can quickly adjust the image embedding space to that class. The few-shot learning could be done by updating prototype vectors or by fine-tuning the detector’s head slightly – far less effort than adding a class in a traditional detector (which would normally require full retraining).
    
*   **Output Formats:** Since you originally used Mask R-CNN, you might want segmentation masks. You can indeed get masks by applying something like **Mask2Former** or using SAM on the detected boxes. But primarily, the pipeline gives bounding boxes. If masks are needed, one idea is to incorporate SAM in the inference loop: for each detected box, run SAM with a prompt point inside that box to get a precise segmentation. Given SAM is zero-shot for segmentation, it pairs well with an open-vocab detector which is zero-shot for classification.
    
*   **Real-Time Querying vs Pre-indexing:** You wondered if you could _“store image content (embeddings) and define objects of interest after the fact”_ instead of reprocessing images for each new query. In practice, a hybrid approach is possible. For example, you could **precompute and store the visual embeddings of all proposals** in each large image (perhaps store the feature vectors for all SAM-proposed regions, or for a grid of patches). Then, later on, when you have a new object query, you **only need to embed the query text or image and compare to the stored features** – essentially a nearest-neighbor search in the embedding space. This is feasible using vector databases or even simple indexing if the data isn’t too huge. Storing embeddings for _every possible patch_ of 30TB is not feasible, but storing ~hundreds of proposals per image is. For instance, if SAM or RPN gives 500 candidate regions in an image, that’s 500 feature vectors (say 512-D each) per image – which across, say, 100k images is 50 million vectors, manageable with approximate nearest neighbor search. This way, you can avoid recomputing deep features on the entire archive for each new object search; you only do a fast embedding lookup. Many image search systems adopt this paradigm. As long as your feature space is well-aligned with semantics, this will allow **post-hoc querying** of the archive for arbitrary objects.
    

By designing the detector in an open-vocabulary manner, we essentially future-proof it: adding a new target class means _writing a new prompt or providing an example_, rather than labelling thousands of images and retraining a monolithic model. This addresses your concern that with previous methods, _“adding classes is difficult and requires reprocessing old images”_. With our approach, old images have already been processed into embeddings; finding a new class in them is a matter of querying those embeddings, not rerunning a full detection model from scratch.

Robustness to Unusual and Rare Instances
----------------------------------------

Another important goal is to ensure the system is **robust to out-of-distribution occurrences** – e.g. a ship on land or an airplane in an odd location. Our approach tackles this on multiple fronts:

*   **Diverse Training Data:** The self-supervised pretraining on 30TB of imagery will expose the model to countless environments and contexts, more than any supervised set could. This broad exposure tends to make the features more context-agnostic – the model learns to focus on objects themselves, not just typical context. In fact, foundation models are praised for their _robustness and generalization_ in remote sensing tasks[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=trends%20and%20the%20significant%20advancements,object%20detection%2C%20and%20other%20applications). We will also augment the supervised fine-tuning with any “odd” examples we can find (perhaps your PDFs or archives contain a few examples of ships inland, etc.). By explicitly including such cases in training (even if only a few), we can teach the model that, say, _“a ship is a ship, even if on land”_.
    
*   **Open-Vocab Semantics:** Using semantic descriptors for detection means the model relies on the object’s visual and textual definition, rather than the surrounding pixels. For example, if we query “ship”, the detector will look for regions that _look like a ship_ (long, hull, etc.) regardless of background. In contrast, a conventional detector trained only on ships-in-water might have implicitly learned that water context = ship. Our approach is less prone to that trap because the “ship” prototype is defined by either a text description (“watercraft with deck and hull”) or by diverse examples (some could be ships in docks, ships on land from scrapyards, etc.). This should inherently improve robustness to odd contexts.
    
*   **Few-Shot Updates:** If a truly novel scenario pops up (say, a new camouflage or a new platform we’ve never seen), the system can quickly adapt by few-shot learning. Because it’s designed to ingest new classes or variants easily, you could feed a handful of examples of the new appearance and update the prototypes. This agility means the model won’t remain brittle in the face of new distribution shifts.
    
*   **Evaluation & Iteration:** It’s worth setting aside some of your data as a _validation set specifically for unusual cases_. Monitor the detector’s performance on these (e.g. a plane in a building, a ship on land). If it struggles, you might generate synthetic data to help. For instance, you could paste object chips into uncommon contexts as augmented training data (copy a ship onto a land background). With diffusion models or image editing, one can even create semi-realistic composites. This kind of targeted augmentation could be a short-term hack to improve robustness.
    

Ultimately, a combination of _massive pretraining_, _semantic open-class reasoning_, and _targeted fine-tuning_ should yield a detector that doesn’t blink when encountering weird situations – it will identify the object for what it is, not where it is.

Training at Scale and Timeline
------------------------------

Given your 128×80GB GPU setup and ~2-week timeline for initial results, a phased training plan is realistic:

1.  **Week 1:** Focus on self-supervised pretraining of the backbone on unlabeled images. Use a distributed training framework (PyTorch DDP or Lightning, etc.) to spread batches across all GPUs. With 128 A100s, you can process enormous batches quickly – perhaps in the order of 1e5 images per epoch. In one week, you could conceivably run a few epochs over a significant subset of the 30TB (depending on I/O). Choose an SSL method that is known to converge fast; _DINOv2_ by Meta, for example, is a recipe that produced a robust ViT by training on 1 billion images (though that took more compute than we have, but we can aim for a smaller scale). Monitor the loss and ensure the model is indeed learning features (e.g. visualize some attention maps or do a quick linear probe to verify it's not random).
    
2.  **Week 2:** Set up the open-vocabulary detection fine-tuning. This stage uses your ~100 labeled images (with 30k labeled objects) as supervised data for the detection task _and_ possibly uses pseudo-labels and the image-text data. A possible curriculum:
    
    *   Fine-tune the pretrained backbone with a detection head (say a DETR or Faster R-CNN style head) on the **base classes** (ships, planes, etc.) for which you have labels. Also include a background class. Use multi-scale training if possible (e.g. random image rescaling) to help detect various sizes. Because the backbone is already good, this fine-tuning can reach high mAP on these classes relatively quickly (a few days of training at most).
        
    *   Next, integrate the **CLIP-based classification**. Freeze or remove the old softmax classifier, and instead attach the embedding-based classifier. You can either freeze the backbone at this point (to preserve its learned features) and just train a small adaptation layer, or continue fine-tuning lightly. Train the detector to output embeddings for proposals that match the ground-truth class embeddings. For example, for each GT box of class “ship”, treat the text embedding of “ship” as a target, and train the proposal feature to be close to it (this is like knowledge distillation from class name to proposal). Microsoft’s **Detic** (Zhou et al. 2022) did something similar by using hundreds of class names as weak supervision for detection. This step will align the detector’s feature space with the text space.
        
    *   Meanwhile, use the **PDF image-text pairs** to train the text encoder (if not done in week 1). Possibly do this in parallel on separate GPUs. Once the text encoder is ready, you can use it in the above step. You could also do joint training where detection and image-text contrastive learning happen together (a multi-task learning approach), though that is more complex.
        
    *   If time permits, run a round of **pseudo-labeling**: apply the emerging open-vocab detector to a portion of the unlabeled 30TB images to see if it discovers new objects. For example, have it output any high-confidence detections for the prompt set {“ship”, “airplane”, “vehicle”, “building”} on those images. You might find that it detects some ships or planes in new places. Add these pseudo-labeled instances to the training set (with appropriate filtering for precision), and continue training. This can gradually expand the model’s coverage.
        

Given two weeks, you might not fully iterate over all steps, but you can get an initial model out and tested. The beauty of this approach is that it is **incremental** – you can keep improving the model with more unlabeled data and more classes over time, without starting over. The heavy lift is mostly up front (pretraining the foundation). After that, each new class or new dataset can be folded in with relatively little compute.

Conclusion and Future Directions
--------------------------------

By combining a **foundation model** for vision (robust features from massive unlabeled data) with a **vision-language approach** (to leverage domain knowledge and enable open-set queries), you will have a cutting-edge object detection system for satellite images. This system should:

*   Achieve high detection accuracy on known target classes (e.g. all ships and aircraft) by leveraging both labeled data and abundant unlabeled imagery (via self-supervised learning and semi-supervised fine-tuning). Expect a significant boost in detection performance compared to your older ResNet50-based model – foundation models in remote sensing have reported substantial mAP gains on benchmarks[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=On%20the%20DOTA%20dataset%2C%20RVSA,for%20specific%20remote%20sensing%20applications).
    
*   **Generalize to new object categories** with zero or few examples, thanks to the open-vocabulary design. You’ll be able to search historical imagery for objects of interest defined by a text description or a prototype image – without retraining a specialized detector each time. This addresses the scalability issue of adding new classes. The detector essentially becomes a general _“query-able”_ index of your imagery.
    
*   **Adapt to unusual scenarios** better than before. Through broad training and semantic understanding, the model is less likely to be confused by context. A plane in an unexpected location should still trigger a _“plane”_ detection because the visual features match, and the model’s semantic priors know that planes **can** be on roads or museums, etc. Moreover, any remaining blind spots can be patched by feeding a few examples to the model (few-shot learning), rather than requiring a full new dataset.
    
*   Utilize **multimodal data** (imagery + text) in a unified way. The PDF documents’ information will enrich the model’s knowledge – essentially functioning as a form of transfer learning from human domain experts. This is relatively novel in automated object detection, so you’d be at the forefront of exploiting textual intelligence in a vision model. Research indicates that combining textual and visual cues yields superior performance in remote sensing tasks[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/24/4693#:~:text=prototype%20aggregating%20module%20to%20integrate,remote%20sensing%20scenarios%20remains%20unexplored)[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/24/4693#:~:text=extraction%20capabilities%20of%20prototypes,generalization%20capabilities%2C%20as%20the%20text), which bodes well for your application.
    

Finally, ensure to set up a strong evaluation pipeline. Given the open-ended nature, you’ll want to evaluate not just on traditional metrics (mAP on a fixed set of classes) but also test the system’s ability to retrieve novel targets. You could simulate “zero-shot” tests by holding out some object classes during training and then asking the model to find them via text prompts, measuring how well it recovers them. This will give a sense of its true discovery capabilities. Keep an eye on failure modes: are there systematic false positives (e.g. confusing ships vs. buildings in some conditions)? Are there biases from the PDF data (e.g. the model only recognizes an object if described in a certain way)? Use such insights to refine the training – the modular design (separating vision and language components) makes it easier to tweak one part without breaking everything.

In summary, the path forward is to **train a powerful general-purpose feature extractor on your satellite imagery**, and **marry it with a flexible detection head driven by both visual and linguistic knowledge**. This approach is state-of-the-art in both research and practice for scenarios exactly like yours. With your abundant data and compute, you are well-positioned to push the state of the art in small object detection in large-scale satellite images. Good luck, and happy detecting!

Advanced Object Detection and Classification in Satellite Imagery Using Foundation Models

State-of-the-Art Small Object Detection in Gigapixel Satellite Images
=====================================================================

Introduction and Challenges
---------------------------

Detecting small, rare objects in **very large satellite images** (e.g. 50,000×100,000 pixels) is extremely challenging. Traditional supervised methods (e.g. fine-tuning an ImageNet-pretrained ResNet+Mask R-CNN) struggle to generalize beyond a fixed set of classes and require constant addition of new training data. Key challenges include:

*   **Gigapixel Image Size:** A single image may be billions of pixels, far exceeding typical CNN/transformer input sizes. Processing such imagery requires tiling or multi-scale strategies.
    
*   **Small Object Scale:** Targets like vehicles or buildings occupy only a few pixels to a few dozen pixels, making them hard to detect against complex backgrounds. They can be easily missed or confused with clutter.
    
*   **Rare Object Occurrence & Class Imbalance:** Some object types appear in only 1 out of 100 or 1000 images. Even common objects (cars, planes, ships) occupy a tiny fraction of pixels in an image. This sparsity means an **overwhelming background** dominates training, and models can quickly bias toward “no object” unless guided well.
    
*   **Limited Labeled Data:** You only have ~100 fully annotated images (~30,000 object instances) – not nearly enough to cover the variability of all object types and conditions.
    
*   **Abundant Unlabeled Data:** Conversely, you possess ~30 TB of unlabeled imagery. Leveraging this vast data via self-supervised or semi-supervised learning is crucial for success[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=computational%20resources%2C%20and%20improved%20model,object%20detection%2C%20and%20other%20applications). Recent surveys note that _self-supervised pre-training (contrastive learning, masked autoencoders, etc.) significantly boosts remote sensing object detection performance and robustness_[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=finds%20that%20pre,object%20detection%2C%20and%20other%20applications).
    
*   **Geo-Temporal Metadata:** Each image comes with geolocation, acquisition time, and sensor parameters. These could provide context (e.g. certain objects only in specific regions or times), though such metadata is rarely used in current detection models. Incorporating it without overfitting remains an open question.
    
*   **Evolving or Open Set of Target Classes:** You ultimately want the flexibility to detect **new object categories on the fly** – e.g. find “buildings that look like _this_” or a rare object described in text – without having to retrain a dedicated detector for each new class. This calls for an _open-vocabulary_ or _post-hoc query_ approach rather than a closed-set classifier.
    

In summary, the task demands a solution that can **learn from limited labels + abundant unlabeled data**, handle **gigapixel images and tiny objects**, exploit **textual domain knowledge**, and allow **flexible, future class definitions** (zero-shot or few-shot detection). Below we outline a comprehensive strategy leveraging **foundation models** and modern techniques to meet these requirements.

Leveraging Unlabeled Images with Foundation Models
--------------------------------------------------

Given the massive unlabeled image collection (30 TB), a top priority is to train or fine-tune a **foundation model** on this data. Foundation models – large-scale pretrained models – have revolutionized remote sensing by providing general features that transfer well to tasks like detection[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=sensing%20has%20been%20significantly%20enhanced,achieved%20by%20those%20foundation%20models)[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=computational%20resources%2C%20and%20improved%20model,object%20detection%2C%20and%20other%20applications). We propose:

*   **Self-Supervised Pretraining:** Use methods such as contrastive learning or masked image modeling on countless image _tiles_ cropped from your 30 TB archive. For example, approaches like **SimCLR/MoCo/SwAV** (contrastive) or **MAE/BEiT** (masked autoencoders) can learn robust feature representations without labels. In remote sensing, self-supervised pretraining (e.g. Seasonal Contrast (SeCo), DINO, SatMAE) has shown big gains in detection performance[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=computational%20resources%2C%20and%20improved%20model,object%20detection%2C%20and%20other%20applications)[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=On%20the%20DOTA%20dataset%2C%20RVSA,for%20specific%20remote%20sensing%20applications). A survey reports foundation models achieving **80%+ mAP** on benchmarks like DOTA (large-scale object detection dataset) after self-supervised pretraining[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=On%20the%20DOTA%20dataset%2C%20RVSA,the%20best%20possible%20performance%20for) – far better than training from scratch. The learned backbone will serve as a strong feature extractor for small objects.
    
*   **Transformer Backbones:** Modern vision transformers (ViT, Swin Transformer) or hybrid CNN-Transformers are preferred as they handle long-range context well. Transformers have proven effective in remote sensing by modeling large receptive fields[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=Transformers%2C%20originally%20designed%20for%20natural,proposed%20by%20Vaswani%20et%20al). Many recent remote-sensing foundation models use ViT or Swin backbones[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=ResNet,B)[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=%5B40%20%5D%20Levir,B%20SSL%2025.6M%2F87.8M). With 128 A100 GPUs, you can afford to train a hefty model (even ViT-Large or Swin-L) on millions of image patches.
    
*   **Tiling and Multi-Scale Training:** Since you cannot feed a 50k×100k image at full resolution into a model, implement a tiling strategy. For pretraining, randomly sample smaller sub-images (e.g. 512×512 or 1024×1024 pixels) across the dataset. Use aggressive data augmentation (random crops, rotations, etc.) to expose the model to varied scales and orientations of objects. You might also incorporate a multi-scale pyramid in the model (like an FPN or ViT with patch sizes) so that objects of different sizes can be detected.
    
*   **Geospatial Metadata Integration:** While pretraining, one idea is to concatenate metadata (location coordinates, timestamp, sensor ID) into the input. For instance, encode lat/long as sine/cosine features or a learned embedding, and append it to the image token sequence or into the model’s late layers. This could allow the model to learn correlations like _ships more likely near coasts_. However, this should be done carefully – the model must still detect _ships anywhere_ if they appear out-of-distribution. There is little literature on using geo-tags in detectors; most foundation models stick to imagery alone. One notable example is **GeoKR** which injected geographic knowledge into ResNet features[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=Geographic%20Coverage%20Visual%20Encoder%20Pretrain,5M%20%202022%20Jul), but generally the gains from metadata are not well-explored. You can treat this as an experimental addition: perhaps start without it, then compare if adding a “metadata branch” improves precision on rare cases.
    

By the end of this stage, you would have a **strong, domain-specific visual backbone** (a pretrained transformer) that knows how to represent satellite imagery features. This backbone can be used for downstream detection and should be much more robust than ImageNet features for your task. For example, a foundation model “RVSA” (ResNet+ViT trained on remote images) achieved **81.2% mAP** on DOTA detection[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=On%20the%20DOTA%20dataset%2C%20RVSA,the%20best%20possible%20performance%20for), whereas earlier methods without such pretraining were substantially lower. The rich feature representations from self-supervised learning will help discriminate tiny objects from clutter.

Utilizing Domain Knowledge from PDF Documents
---------------------------------------------

You have thousands of PDF documents containing annotated image chips, maps, and text descriptions – a treasure trove of _domain-specific knowledge_. We should **harness the multimodal (image + text) information** in these PDFs to guide the model. Possible steps:

*   **Image-Text Pair Extraction:** Develop a pipeline to extract each figure or image from the PDFs along with any corresponding caption or descriptive text in the document. Your current approach with PyMuPDF + Google Gemma-27B (multimodal model) is a good start. To improve it, ensure you capture: (a) the raw image (satellite chip or diagram), (b) any caption below the image, and (c) any call-outs or labels on the image (via OCR if text is embedded in the image). It might help to use a PDF-specific tool that preserves layout, so you can associate captions like “Figure 3: \[description\]…” with the right image. If the PDFs have annotated maps (e.g. red circles around objects), consider if those annotations can be parsed (some PDFs might have vector drawing layers). If not, you could even apply an object detector to the extracted figure to find the marked objects (since those figures are smaller, this is feasible).
    
*   **Build a Remote Sensing “CLIP” dataset:** Using the extracted image-text pairs, you can create a dataset for **vision-language pretraining**. Each image chip from the PDF, paired with its description or the surrounding text, becomes a training sample. Even if you only get on the order of 10k–100k such pairs, they carry highly relevant semantics (e.g. “a missile launcher hiding under camouflage netting in a desert”). This can be used to _fine-tune a CLIP model_ or similar on your domain. Recent work shows that adapting CLIP to remote sensing yields huge benefits for zero-shot recognition. For instance, **RS-CLIP**, a CLIP model trained on remote sensing image-text data, achieved up to **95% accuracy in zero-shot scene classification**, vastly outperforming the original CLIP on that domain[centaur.reading.ac.uk](https://centaur.reading.ac.uk/119820/#:~:text=CentAUR%20centaur,21%2C). In your case, a domain-tuned CLIP will learn the language of your PDFs – linking phrases to satellite imagery patterns.
    
*   **Vision-Language Model Integration:** Once you have a domain CLIP (or a similar vision-language model), incorporate it into the detection pipeline (detailed next). The simplest use-case is **search and retrieval**: you could embed all your imagery (or candidate object patches) into CLIP’s visual embedding space, and embed a text query (e.g. _“small building with a dome roof”_) into the text space – the model can then find image regions with high similarity to the query. This directly enables _zero-shot object search_ over your image archive. Indeed, open-vocabulary detection methods often rely on CLIP embeddings to classify proposals by comparing image vs. text features in a shared space[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2311.11646#:~:text=on%20massive%20image,transfers%20knowledge%20from%20a%20pre). Keep in mind the finding by Bou _et al._ (2024) that a generic CLIP may lack fine-grained remote sensing vocabulary, whereas purely visual features like DINOv2 performed better on satellite object detection[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05381#:~:text=containing%20challenging%20and%20rare%20objects,datasets%2C%20despite%20minimal%20training%20parameters). **Solution:** use the PDF text to teach the model domain-specific vocabulary (class names and traits). By training CLIP on your data (or at least fine-tuning it), the text encoder will learn terms like _“SAM site”_, _“mobile launcher”_, _“dry dock”_, etc., which don’t appear often in ordinary CLIP training. This will narrow the gap so that text embeddings truly reflect your target objects.
    
*   **Multimodal Prototype Learning:** Another way to use text is as _“prototypes”_ for classes. Research on few-shot detection in remote sensing suggests combining **textual descriptions with visual exemplars** yields the best results[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/24/4693#:~:text=detection%2C%20constructing%20class%20prototypes%20from,both%20worlds%2C%20we%20propose%20a)[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/24/4693#:~:text=textual%20class%20names%20are%20processed,modal). Intuitively, a text embedding (from a language model like BERT or CLIP’s text tower) carries high-level semantic knowledge (e.g. a “ship” is a watercraft, usually in water, etc.), while a visual embedding of a few example chips carries specific appearance details. Liu _et al._ (2024) fuse textual and visual prototypes to create multi-modal class representations, and report up to **+8.7% AP50 improvement** in few-shot object detection performance[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/24/4693#:~:text=prototype%20aggregating%20module%20to%20integrate,remote%20sensing%20scenarios%20remains%20unexplored)[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/24/4693#:~:text=Figure%202,art%20approaches). We can adopt a similar idea: for any new target class, define it by a textual description _and_ (if available) a few image examples. The detector’s classifier can then be a _matching function_ that checks a region’s feature against these multi-modal class prototypes. This approach is more flexible than a fixed linear classifier and naturally extends to new classes without retraining the entire model.
    

In summary, the PDF-derived data allows us to imbue the model with **contextual and semantic knowledge** beyond what raw pixels provide. It’s like having an expert guide the model: the text can describe _how to recognize a rare object_, and the image chips provide exemplars. We will leverage this in building an **open-vocabulary detection system** below.

Open-Vocabulary Detection and Classification
--------------------------------------------

Instead of training a conventional detector locked to N predefined classes, we recommend an **open-vocabulary object detection (OVD)** approach. This means the detector can potentially detect _any object category_, given a suitable description or example of that category – addressing your need to add new classes without reprocessing all images. There are a few components to achieve this:

*   **Region Proposal Network (RPN) or Segmenter:** First, we need to generate candidate regions in the large image that _might contain any object_. These proposals should be _class-agnostic_. Traditional detectors use either sliding-window anchors or learned RPNs that are trained on known objects. For open-vocab, we can still train an RPN on the base classes (like vehicles) just to get it to propose regions that _look “objecty”_ in general. Alternatively, we can use a powerful pretrained segmenter like **SAM (Segment Anything Model)** to propose masks for **all objects** in an image. SAM, when given an image, can generate ~everything that looks like a discrete object or part in that scene. It has been shown to work on satellite images as well. The idea would be: run SAM (or an RPN) on each image tile to generate a set of candidate object bounding boxes or masks (this can be done offline and stored if needed). This addresses finding the needles in the haystack (small objects in huge images) without yet knowing what they are.
    
*   **Feature Extraction for Proposals:** For each candidate region, extract a feature descriptor using our **foundation backbone** (the one pretrained on 30TB of imagery). This could be, for example, a ViT feature vector from that region (or a RoI pooled feature from a CNN). Because the backbone was trained on diverse data, these features will encode the object’s visual appearance in a rich way.
    
*   **Open-Vocabulary Classification:** Now, instead of a fixed classifier head, classify a region by comparing its feature to **embeddings of class names or descriptions**. This is where the domain **CLIP** model (or a text encoder) comes in. We obtain a text embedding for each class of interest (e.g. the word “aircraft”, or a phrase “small propeller airplane”). The region is assigned the class whose text embedding is most similar to the region’s visual embedding (via cosine similarity)[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2311.11646#:~:text=on%20massive%20image,transfers%20knowledge%20from%20a%20pre). This effectively lets us have _thousands of potential classes_ without training a separate neuron for each – we just compute their text embeddings. If you have example images of a new class rather than a name, you can also embed those through the vision encoder and use them as “visual class prototypes” in the same embedding space. Recent open-vocab detectors follow this paradigm. For example, **ViLD (Viision-Language Detection)** by Google used a CLIP image encoder to embed region proposals and a CLIP text encoder for class names, matching them in a shared space[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2311.11646#:~:text=on%20massive%20image,transfers%20knowledge%20from%20a%20pre). Microsoft’s **GLIP** went further by _jointly training_ a detector on detection data _plus_ image-caption pairs, so it learned to align detection with text descriptions directly[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2311.11646#:~:text=vocabularies%20than%20conventional%20nature%20image,class%20similarity%20and). In your case, we can fine-tune such a model on your data (using your 100 labeled images for supervision on base classes like ships/planes, while also exposing it to image-text pairs from the PDFs to teach the alignment). The result will be a detector that can take a **text query at inference (“find building with a dome”)** and output boxes where such objects are present.
    
*   **Student-Teacher Self-Training:** Since you have so much unlabeled data, we should also exploit _pseudo-labeling_ to expand to novel classes. A cutting-edge approach, **CastDet (ECCV 2024)**, did exactly this for aerial images: it used a CLIP-based teacher to propose and label new objects in unlabeled images, and a student detector to learn from those pseudo-labels[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11646#:~:text=performance%20of%20OVD%20greatly%20relies,We%20conduct%20extensive)[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2311.11646#:~:text=pseudo,extensive%20experiments%20on%20multiple%20existing). Essentially, the CLIP model can score proposals for any class via the text embeddings – we take high-confidence detections on unlabeled images as new “labels” and retrain/refine the detector. This iterative self-training can discover **rare objects** that were not in the original 100 labeled images. CastDet reported a **large improvement (≈+21 mAP)** on novel object detection in aerial scenes by using a CLIP teacher in this way[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11646#:~:text=up%20for%20the%20OVD%20task,available%20at%20this%20https%20URL). You could employ a similar strategy: use your domain-CLIP as a teacher to tag occurrences of, say, a **new vehicle type** across the unlabeled dataset, then incorporate those as additional training data. Over time, the model’s vocabulary of detectable objects grows, without explicit human labeling.
    

_Open-vocabulary detection concept: Instead of fixed-class prediction, the detector compares proposal features with text or image embeddings. (Left) A traditional CLIP-based OVD uses CLIP as a frozen teacher to classify proposals; (Right) a hybrid approach injects CLIP knowledge into a student–teacher detection model for learning new classes[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2311.11646#:~:text=Image%3A%20Refer%20to%20caption%20Figure,an%20external%20knowledge%20source%20to)._

The above figure illustrates how we can integrate a CLIP-like model into the training process. In our implementation, the “teacher” could be the domain-adapted CLIP (trained on PDF data) that guides the detector to high-quality proposals and provides semantic labels for them[ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2311.11646#:~:text=pseudo,extensive%20experiments%20on%20multiple%20existing). The “student” is our main detector that we train end-to-end. This way, the **broad knowledge in CLIP (about many object types)** is distilled into the detector. By the end, you should have a model that detects **common objects with high precision** (thanks to supervised training on those 30k labels) and can also **localize unseen objects** given a description or few examples (thanks to the open-vocab design and CLIP’s knowledge).

A few additional notes on making this work:

*   **Thresholding and Calibration:** In zero-shot settings, false positives can be an issue (the model might see _“objects”_ everywhere for a vague query). You will need to calibrate similarity score thresholds for detection. One trick is to always include a “background” or “none of the above” category embedding in the comparison – for example, an embedding of the word “background” or an average of many random image embeddings – to represent no-object. The detector should only output a box if its similarity to a real class exceeds similarity to “background” by a margin. This was used in some OVD methods to reduce false alarms.
    
*   **Few-Shot Fine-tuning:** If zero-shot detection of a new class is not sufficiently accurate, the framework easily supports a _few-shot fine-tune_. Because the backbone is strong and the classifier is based on embeddings, training on say 10–20 labeled examples of the new class can quickly adjust the image embedding space to that class. The few-shot learning could be done by updating prototype vectors or by fine-tuning the detector’s head slightly – far less effort than adding a class in a traditional detector (which would normally require full retraining).
    
*   **Output Formats:** Since you originally used Mask R-CNN, you might want segmentation masks. You can indeed get masks by applying something like **Mask2Former** or using SAM on the detected boxes. But primarily, the pipeline gives bounding boxes. If masks are needed, one idea is to incorporate SAM in the inference loop: for each detected box, run SAM with a prompt point inside that box to get a precise segmentation. Given SAM is zero-shot for segmentation, it pairs well with an open-vocab detector which is zero-shot for classification.
    
*   **Real-Time Querying vs Pre-indexing:** You wondered if you could _“store image content (embeddings) and define objects of interest after the fact”_ instead of reprocessing images for each new query. In practice, a hybrid approach is possible. For example, you could **precompute and store the visual embeddings of all proposals** in each large image (perhaps store the feature vectors for all SAM-proposed regions, or for a grid of patches). Then, later on, when you have a new object query, you **only need to embed the query text or image and compare to the stored features** – essentially a nearest-neighbor search in the embedding space. This is feasible using vector databases or even simple indexing if the data isn’t too huge. Storing embeddings for _every possible patch_ of 30TB is not feasible, but storing ~hundreds of proposals per image is. For instance, if SAM or RPN gives 500 candidate regions in an image, that’s 500 feature vectors (say 512-D each) per image – which across, say, 100k images is 50 million vectors, manageable with approximate nearest neighbor search. This way, you can avoid recomputing deep features on the entire archive for each new object search; you only do a fast embedding lookup. Many image search systems adopt this paradigm. As long as your feature space is well-aligned with semantics, this will allow **post-hoc querying** of the archive for arbitrary objects.
    

By designing the detector in an open-vocabulary manner, we essentially future-proof it: adding a new target class means _writing a new prompt or providing an example_, rather than labelling thousands of images and retraining a monolithic model. This addresses your concern that with previous methods, _“adding classes is difficult and requires reprocessing old images”_. With our approach, old images have already been processed into embeddings; finding a new class in them is a matter of querying those embeddings, not rerunning a full detection model from scratch.

Robustness to Unusual and Rare Instances
----------------------------------------

Another important goal is to ensure the system is **robust to out-of-distribution occurrences** – e.g. a ship on land or an airplane in an odd location. Our approach tackles this on multiple fronts:

*   **Diverse Training Data:** The self-supervised pretraining on 30TB of imagery will expose the model to countless environments and contexts, more than any supervised set could. This broad exposure tends to make the features more context-agnostic – the model learns to focus on objects themselves, not just typical context. In fact, foundation models are praised for their _robustness and generalization_ in remote sensing tasks[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=trends%20and%20the%20significant%20advancements,object%20detection%2C%20and%20other%20applications). We will also augment the supervised fine-tuning with any “odd” examples we can find (perhaps your PDFs or archives contain a few examples of ships inland, etc.). By explicitly including such cases in training (even if only a few), we can teach the model that, say, _“a ship is a ship, even if on land”_.
    
*   **Open-Vocab Semantics:** Using semantic descriptors for detection means the model relies on the object’s visual and textual definition, rather than the surrounding pixels. For example, if we query “ship”, the detector will look for regions that _look like a ship_ (long, hull, etc.) regardless of background. In contrast, a conventional detector trained only on ships-in-water might have implicitly learned that water context = ship. Our approach is less prone to that trap because the “ship” prototype is defined by either a text description (“watercraft with deck and hull”) or by diverse examples (some could be ships in docks, ships on land from scrapyards, etc.). This should inherently improve robustness to odd contexts.
    
*   **Few-Shot Updates:** If a truly novel scenario pops up (say, a new camouflage or a new platform we’ve never seen), the system can quickly adapt by few-shot learning. Because it’s designed to ingest new classes or variants easily, you could feed a handful of examples of the new appearance and update the prototypes. This agility means the model won’t remain brittle in the face of new distribution shifts.
    
*   **Evaluation & Iteration:** It’s worth setting aside some of your data as a _validation set specifically for unusual cases_. Monitor the detector’s performance on these (e.g. a plane in a building, a ship on land). If it struggles, you might generate synthetic data to help. For instance, you could paste object chips into uncommon contexts as augmented training data (copy a ship onto a land background). With diffusion models or image editing, one can even create semi-realistic composites. This kind of targeted augmentation could be a short-term hack to improve robustness.
    

Ultimately, a combination of _massive pretraining_, _semantic open-class reasoning_, and _targeted fine-tuning_ should yield a detector that doesn’t blink when encountering weird situations – it will identify the object for what it is, not where it is.

Training at Scale and Timeline
------------------------------

Given your 128×80GB GPU setup and ~2-week timeline for initial results, a phased training plan is realistic:

1.  **Week 1:** Focus on self-supervised pretraining of the backbone on unlabeled images. Use a distributed training framework (PyTorch DDP or Lightning, etc.) to spread batches across all GPUs. With 128 A100s, you can process enormous batches quickly – perhaps in the order of 1e5 images per epoch. In one week, you could conceivably run a few epochs over a significant subset of the 30TB (depending on I/O). Choose an SSL method that is known to converge fast; _DINOv2_ by Meta, for example, is a recipe that produced a robust ViT by training on 1 billion images (though that took more compute than we have, but we can aim for a smaller scale). Monitor the loss and ensure the model is indeed learning features (e.g. visualize some attention maps or do a quick linear probe to verify it's not random).
    
2.  **Week 2:** Set up the open-vocabulary detection fine-tuning. This stage uses your ~100 labeled images (with 30k labeled objects) as supervised data for the detection task _and_ possibly uses pseudo-labels and the image-text data. A possible curriculum:
    
    *   Fine-tune the pretrained backbone with a detection head (say a DETR or Faster R-CNN style head) on the **base classes** (ships, planes, etc.) for which you have labels. Also include a background class. Use multi-scale training if possible (e.g. random image rescaling) to help detect various sizes. Because the backbone is already good, this fine-tuning can reach high mAP on these classes relatively quickly (a few days of training at most).
        
    *   Next, integrate the **CLIP-based classification**. Freeze or remove the old softmax classifier, and instead attach the embedding-based classifier. You can either freeze the backbone at this point (to preserve its learned features) and just train a small adaptation layer, or continue fine-tuning lightly. Train the detector to output embeddings for proposals that match the ground-truth class embeddings. For example, for each GT box of class “ship”, treat the text embedding of “ship” as a target, and train the proposal feature to be close to it (this is like knowledge distillation from class name to proposal). Microsoft’s **Detic** (Zhou et al. 2022) did something similar by using hundreds of class names as weak supervision for detection. This step will align the detector’s feature space with the text space.
        
    *   Meanwhile, use the **PDF image-text pairs** to train the text encoder (if not done in week 1). Possibly do this in parallel on separate GPUs. Once the text encoder is ready, you can use it in the above step. You could also do joint training where detection and image-text contrastive learning happen together (a multi-task learning approach), though that is more complex.
        
    *   If time permits, run a round of **pseudo-labeling**: apply the emerging open-vocab detector to a portion of the unlabeled 30TB images to see if it discovers new objects. For example, have it output any high-confidence detections for the prompt set {“ship”, “airplane”, “vehicle”, “building”} on those images. You might find that it detects some ships or planes in new places. Add these pseudo-labeled instances to the training set (with appropriate filtering for precision), and continue training. This can gradually expand the model’s coverage.
        

Given two weeks, you might not fully iterate over all steps, but you can get an initial model out and tested. The beauty of this approach is that it is **incremental** – you can keep improving the model with more unlabeled data and more classes over time, without starting over. The heavy lift is mostly up front (pretraining the foundation). After that, each new class or new dataset can be folded in with relatively little compute.

Conclusion and Future Directions
--------------------------------

By combining a **foundation model** for vision (robust features from massive unlabeled data) with a **vision-language approach** (to leverage domain knowledge and enable open-set queries), you will have a cutting-edge object detection system for satellite images. This system should:

*   Achieve high detection accuracy on known target classes (e.g. all ships and aircraft) by leveraging both labeled data and abundant unlabeled imagery (via self-supervised learning and semi-supervised fine-tuning). Expect a significant boost in detection performance compared to your older ResNet50-based model – foundation models in remote sensing have reported substantial mAP gains on benchmarks[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2408.03464v1#:~:text=On%20the%20DOTA%20dataset%2C%20RVSA,for%20specific%20remote%20sensing%20applications).
    
*   **Generalize to new object categories** with zero or few examples, thanks to the open-vocabulary design. You’ll be able to search historical imagery for objects of interest defined by a text description or a prototype image – without retraining a specialized detector each time. This addresses the scalability issue of adding new classes. The detector essentially becomes a general _“query-able”_ index of your imagery.
    
*   **Adapt to unusual scenarios** better than before. Through broad training and semantic understanding, the model is less likely to be confused by context. A plane in an unexpected location should still trigger a _“plane”_ detection because the visual features match, and the model’s semantic priors know that planes **can** be on roads or museums, etc. Moreover, any remaining blind spots can be patched by feeding a few examples to the model (few-shot learning), rather than requiring a full new dataset.
    
*   Utilize **multimodal data** (imagery + text) in a unified way. The PDF documents’ information will enrich the model’s knowledge – essentially functioning as a form of transfer learning from human domain experts. This is relatively novel in automated object detection, so you’d be at the forefront of exploiting textual intelligence in a vision model. Research indicates that combining textual and visual cues yields superior performance in remote sensing tasks[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/24/4693#:~:text=prototype%20aggregating%20module%20to%20integrate,remote%20sensing%20scenarios%20remains%20unexplored)[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/24/4693#:~:text=extraction%20capabilities%20of%20prototypes,generalization%20capabilities%2C%20as%20the%20text), which bodes well for your application.
    

Finally, ensure to set up a strong evaluation pipeline. Given the open-ended nature, you’ll want to evaluate not just on traditional metrics (mAP on a fixed set of classes) but also test the system’s ability to retrieve novel targets. You could simulate “zero-shot” tests by holding out some object classes during training and then asking the model to find them via text prompts, measuring how well it recovers them. This will give a sense of its true discovery capabilities. Keep an eye on failure modes: are there systematic false positives (e.g. confusing ships vs. buildings in some conditions)? Are there biases from the PDF data (e.g. the model only recognizes an object if described in a certain way)? Use such insights to refine the training – the modular design (separating vision and language components) makes it easier to tweak one part without breaking everything.

In summary, the path forward is to **train a powerful general-purpose feature extractor on your satellite imagery**, and **marry it with a flexible detection head driven by both visual and linguistic knowledge**. This approach is state-of-the-art in both research and practice for scenarios exactly like yours. With your abundant data and compute, you are well-positioned to push the state of the art in small object detection in large-scale satellite images. Good luck, and happy detecting!

That's fine for now, thanks. Given all of the above, I was also wondering if it's possible to store embeddings for the processed image tiles as a "compressed representation of a tiles content". Would it then be possible to search for things after the image has been processed? e.g. "find me all the image tiles that contain a ship that looks like this".

Thought for 19s

Short answer: **yes, completely doable**—and this is exactly where your open-vocab setup shines.

Here’s the practical way to do it without blowing up storage or latency:

How to “compress” tiles with embeddings and make them searchable
================================================================

1) Store **multi-scale embeddings**
-----------------------------------

You’ll want three layers of representation, each for a different purpose:

*   **Tile-level** (coarse filter): 1 embedding per tile (e.g., 1024×1024). Compute from your ViT/CLIP image tower using global pooling. Use this to _narrow the search to the top-K tiles_ fast.
    
*   **Patch/grid-level** (optional middle filter): fixed grid per tile (e.g., 16×16 patches → 256 embeddings). Good for “heatmapping” where in the tile the concept likely is.
    
*   **Proposal-level** (fine search): embeddings for candidate objects from RPN/Detectron2/DETR/SAM (we already built this). This is what you’ll match against text prompts or example chips to return _actual hits_.
    

In your pipeline we already index proposal embeddings. Add the **tile-level** index, optionally the **grid** index if you want better coarse recall.

2) Use **ANN indexing + compression**
-------------------------------------

*   Library: **FAISS** (you already use it).
    
*   Index types:
    
    *   Coarse tile index: `IVF,PQ` (e.g., `IndexIVFPQ`) for fast, tiny memory footprint.
        
    *   Proposal index: also `IVF,PQ` or `HNSW` if you prefer graph search (HNSW is great for recall but larger RAM).
        
*   Compression:
    
    *   Raw float32 512-D = ~2 KB/vec; float16 ~1 KB/vec.
        
    *   **Product Quantization (PQ)** can get you to **8–16 bytes/vec** with very tolerable recall loss.
        
*   Metadata: store `(tile_id, geo_hash, timestamp, sensor_id, box_xyxy)` for each vector so you can filter by area, date range, sensor, etc.
    

3) Two-stage query at runtime
-----------------------------

You can do all of this **after** the imagery was processed once—no reprocessing needed to search for new things:

*   **Query types:**
    
    *   **Text** (“ship with a flat bow, white hull”). Embed via your CLIP text tower.
        
    *   **Visual** (“looks like this”). Embed the example chip via your image tower.
        
*   **Stage A (coarse):** search the **tile-level index** for the top-K tiles (e.g., K=2k–10k, tunable).
    
*   **Stage B (fine):** within those tiles, search the **proposal index** and rank detections by cosine sim to the query embedding. (If you also store patch-grid embeddings, you can use them to quickly focus within a tile before proposals.)
    
*   **Return:** tiles (and boxes) with scores; optionally run a light NMS and a similarity threshold.
    

4) Storage & scale ballpark (so you can budget)
-----------------------------------------------

Rules of thumb (you can tune K, PQ bits, etc.):

*   **Tile-level index:**
    
    *   1M tiles × 768-D fp16 ≈ **1.5 GB**; with PQ @ **16 B/vec → ~16 MB**.
        
*   **Proposal-level index:** assume ~300 proposals/tile (SAM/RPN).
    
    *   1M tiles → **300M proposals**.
        
    *   512-D fp16 ≈ **~300 GB**; with PQ @ **16 B/vec → ~4.8 GB**.
        
    *   PQ @ 8 B/vec halves that again with some recall hit.
        

This means you can keep **hundreds of millions of proposal embeddings** in **single-digit GBs** with PQ, which is totally feasible on one beefy node (and trivially sharded across the cluster later).

5) Quality tricks that help
---------------------------

*   **Hybrid scoring:** for text queries, combine CLIP text-image similarity with a tiny learned calibrator (e.g., logistic regression on a few labeled positives/negatives) to reduce text-driven false positives.
    
*   **Class-aware thresholding:** keep a separate similarity threshold per prompt (ships vs planes will behave differently).
    
*   **Geospatial/time filters:** pre-filter candidates by **geohash buckets** and time windows for huge speedups when queries are region- or period-specific.
    
*   **Version your embeddings:** keep `model_version` in metadata so you can re-index incrementally when you upgrade the backbone.
    

6) How this plugs into your codebase (what to add)
--------------------------------------------------

You basically need two small additions to what’s already in your canvas:

1.  **Tile-level embedding + index builder**
    
    *   Read each tile, compute a global pooled feature from your CLIP/DINO/MAE-finetuned backbone (we can reuse `OVMatcher`’s image encoder).
        
    *   Build a FAISS `IndexIVFPQ` (train on a sample, then add all tile vectors).
        
    *   Store a sidecar `tiles_meta.jsonl` with `{tile_path, geohash, time, sensor}`.
        
2.  **Search API**
    
    *   `search_tiles_by_text(prompt, topk_tiles)` → returns tile\_ids; then `search_proposals_in_tiles(query_emb, tile_ids, topk_hits)` to get boxes.
        
    *   For “looks like this” queries, pass an example chip to the same API; it uses image embeddings instead of text embeddings.
        

If you want, I can append ready-to-run code to the canvas for:

*   **Tile-level indexer** (IVF-PQ with auto-training)
    
*   **Search API** (text & visual queries, two-stage)
    
*   **Geospatial sharding** (simple geohash-based folder layout)
    
*   **Batch backfill script** to generate embeddings for your existing tiles and write a manifest
    

Just say the word and I’ll drop those modules in.

You asked:

No thanks, but I did have another question. We need to age off incoming images, I'd like to build as large a dataset as possible for training and have considered preserving image tiles using JPEGXL lossy compression. I can get a large compression ratio, while having a structural similarity index measure (SSIM) well above 0.9 (usually 0.95 to 0.99). I like JPEGXL, as it seems to be faster than JPEG2000. Is this a good idea? Would lossy compression that maintains a SSIM in the mid 0.90's harm the training performance?

---

ChatGPT Replied:

Thought for 13s

Short answer: **JPEG XL is a solid choice** for archiving tiles, but be careful with how lossy you go—**tiny objects are the first casualties**. SSIM 0.95–0.99 _sounds_ high, yet small-target detection is hypersensitive to ringing/blur.

Here’s how I’d handle it:

Practical takeaways
===================

*   **Use JXL, but not uniformly.**
    
    *   **Lossless or near-lossless** for anything with labels, proposals, or that you might want to annotate later.
        
    *   **Higher compression** for background-only tiles.
        
*   **Keep bit depth + sampling.**
    
    *   Don’t down-quantize if your source is 12/16-bit—JXL supports high bit depth.
        
    *   Avoid chroma subsampling (use **4:4:4**). Subsampling can smear fine lines that define small ships/planes.
        
*   **Do proposals _before_ compression.**  
    Run SAM/RPN on the originals, then store:
    
    *   the **proposal boxes/masks** (JSON),
        
    *   the **proposal embeddings** (vectors), and
        
    *   optionally **tight crops** around positives (**lossless** or very mild JXL).  
        You can aggressively compress the rest without losing your ability to search.
        
*   **For training, mix in compression as augmentation.**  
    Train on a blend of original + (mildly) compressed tiles. That makes the model robust to your archived data while anchoring performance with pristine examples.
    
*   **Keep eval pristine.**  
    Always evaluate on **lossless** (or original) imagery so you’re measuring true model capability, not codec quirks.
    

Will SSIM ~0.95–0.99 hurt training?
===================================

*   **Sometimes, yes**—especially for **small objects** and edge-based cues (mast/wing tips, wakes, runway markings). SSIM is global and can be high even when the codec softened crucial micro-structure.
    
*   Expect **earlier drops in recall** for small/rare classes as quality drops, long before SSIM looks “bad”.
    

Better guardrails than SSIM alone:

*   Track **mAP\_small** (COCO small-object AP), not just overall AP.
    
*   Include **LPIPS** or **MS-SSIM** and a **task metric** (mAP) in your QA.
    
*   If you want a quick heuristic: target **PSNR ≥ 45 dB** and **MS-SSIM ≥ 0.98** on representative tiles with known small targets.
    

Storage strategy that works well
================================

1.  **Run your generation pipeline once** on originals:
    
    *   proposals (SAM/RPN/DETR)
        
    *   **proposal embeddings** (we’ve got code for this style)
        
    *   **tile embeddings** (coarse)
        
2.  **Archive tiles with JXL** using a **quality policy**:
    
    *   **Tiles with positives / high edge density:** near-lossless JXL (or lossless for crops)
        
    *   **Background-only tiles:** stronger compression (where your SSIM 0.95–0.97 will often be fine)
        
3.  **Keep a tiny “gold” subset lossless** for periodic retraining/eval.
    
4.  **Version everything** (codec, quality, model\_version) in metadata so you can trace any drift.
    

What to expect
==============

*   For **indexing & search via embeddings**: usually robust to mild compression; cosine similarity degrades slowly.
    
*   For **mask quality** and **very small detections**: most sensitive. Artifacts can nudge SAM/RPN and your detector to miss borderline objects. That’s why we detect/propose first and store those artifacts losslessly.
    

Quick A/B you can run next week
===============================

*   Pick ~5–10k representative tiles (with plenty of small/rare targets).
    
*   Compress at 3–4 JXL settings spanning your SSIM range.
    
*   Train the detector on (a) lossless only vs (b) mixed lossless+compressed.
    
*   Evaluate **mAP\_small**, **recall@0.5** for each class, and compare.
    
*   Also compare **embedding drift**: cosine(original\_emb, compressed\_emb) on proposal crops—watch the tail.
    

Bottom line
===========

*   **Yes, use JPEG XL** for aging off—fast, modern, and friendly to high bit depths.
    
*   **Lossless/near-lossless for anything you care about**, heavier compression for background.
    
*   **Do proposals & embeddings on originals**, store those artifacts and you won’t need to reprocess later.
    
*   **Treat compression as an augmentation** in training to keep performance stable.
    

If you want, I can add a tiny **codec QA script** to your canvas that:

*   compresses a sample set with a few JXL qualities,
    
*   computes SSIM/MS-SSIM/LPIPS,
    
*   measures embedding drift,
    
*   and spits out a table so you can pick a safe quality threshold.

I can absolutely regenerate the full canvas with all previous sections merged back in — including:

1.  **Single-node starter pipeline** for gigapixel, open-vocabulary satellite detection — CLIP-based tiling, DETR/Detectron2 heads, SAM proposer.
    
2.  **Tile-level embedding + FAISS index** for post-hoc search.
    
3.  **JPEG XL QA pipeline** (PSNR/SSIM/MS-SSIM/LPIPS + embedding drift).
    
4.  **Small-object and hard-background QA samplers** for targeted compression evaluation.
    

This would produce a single, contiguous document covering setup, training, evaluation, embedding indexing, search, compression QA, and sampling tools — so you don't lose any earlier context.

You asked:
----------

Have tested first few steps - looks excellent, thanks. One thing I've noticed relates to pixel data type. The first image I randomly picked is single channel 12 bits per pixel (stored as uint16). This datatype makes up the majority of the images, however there's also 4 channel 12 bit, 3 channel 12 bit, 3 channel 8 bit, 8 channel 12 bit (hyper-spectral) etc. It jumped out, as the code crashed (expecting an 8 bit image). This is something I've been fighting with for a long time. Pre-trained backbones all expect 3 channel 8 bit RGB input. I've tried various pre-processing schemes to feed 1 channel 12 bit data in. Usually, I just go with taking the data between the 2nd and 98th percentile and stretching that 0-255 and replicating it across 3 channels. More involved processing hasn't seemed to produce better results. I'm not sure if thats due to my previously limited training data for supervised learning approaches, or if I'm not using optimal techniques. I would really welcome any advice you have on feeding in 12 bit images.

Oh yeah, this is the classic remote-sensing headache: models want cute little 3×8-bit JPEGs, your sensors hand you gloriously weird 1/4/8-channel 12-bit TIFFs. The good news: you don’t have to crush everything to 8-bit RGB. There are three solid patterns that work well, and you can mix them by use case.

What actually works (short version)
===================================

1.  **Keep the physics, add a tiny adapter.**  
    Don’t quantize on disk. Load 12-bit (uint16) → float32, **robust-normalize** (percentile or per-sensor normalization), then pass through a **learned 1×1 conv “SensorAdapter”** that maps C\_in→3 for CLIP/ResNet. Initialize it sanely (e.g., average or PCA) and let it learn. This beats hard-coded RGB replication.
    
2.  **Make the backbone accept your channels.**  
    For **ViTs**, the “first layer” is just a conv patch embed. Set `in_chans=C_in` and initialize by repeating/averaging weights. Do your **SSL pretrain (MAE/DINO) directly on 12-bit float**; don’t fight the data. Then use that image tower for open-vocab matching (via your domain CLIP fine-tune).
    
3.  **Use robust normalization, not just 2–98% per-image.**  
    2–98% is a decent default, but add:
    
    *   **Dataset-/sensor-wide affine** (mean/std or percentiles) to avoid tile-to-tile flicker,
        
    *   **Per-tile robust clip** (e.g., 1–99%) on top,
        
    *   Optional **log/γ** for glare/wakes, and **no chroma subsampling** anywhere.
        

Concrete, drop-in code
======================

A) Robust 12-bit loader + percentile stretch (any C, returns float32)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Use this in your datasets instead of PIL so you don’t explode on uint16.

    # utils/imread_rs.py
    import numpy as np, rasterio
    
    def load_raster_as_float(path, robust=(2,98), per_channel=True):
        """Return float32 array shape [C,H,W] in [0,1], robustly normalized."""
        with rasterio.open(path) as src:
            arr = src.read()  # [C,H,W], dtype often uint16
        arr = arr.astype(np.float32)
        # If it's 12-bit packed in uint16, dynamic range is ~0..4095; but sensors vary.
        # We'll do robust percentile stretch to [0,1].
        def _stretch(x):
            lo, hi = np.percentile(x, robust) if isinstance(robust, (list, tuple)) else (np.min(x), np.max(x))
            if hi <= lo: hi = lo + 1.0
            y = (x - lo) / (hi - lo)
            return np.clip(y, 0.0, 1.0)
        if per_channel:
            for c in range(arr.shape[0]):
                arr[c] = _stretch(arr[c])
        else:
            arr = _stretch(arr)
        return arr  # float32 [C,H,W] in [0,1]
    

B) “SensorAdapter” to feed CLIP/ResNet without RGB hacks
--------------------------------------------------------

Maps arbitrary channels to 3 via a learnable 1×1 conv, then standard CLIP preprocessing.

    # models/sensor_adapter.py
    import torch, torch.nn as nn
    
    class SensorAdapter(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, in_ch, out_ch=3, init='avg'):
            super().__init__()
            self.proj = nn.Conv2d(in_ch, out_ch, kernel_size=1, bias=False)
            with torch.no_grad():
                w = self.proj.weight  # [out_ch, in_ch, 1, 1]
                if init == 'avg':
                    w.zero_(); w[:, :, 0, 0] = 1.0 / in_ch
                elif init == 'first3' and in_ch >= 3:
                    w.zero_()
                    for o in range(3): w[o, o, 0, 0] = 1.0
                # else keep default init
        def forward(self, x):  # x: [B,C,H,W] in [0,1]
            return self.proj(x).clamp(0,1)
    

And a dataset that marries both pieces:

    # data/rs_dataset.py
    import torch
    from torch.utils.data import Dataset
    from utils.imread_rs import load_raster_as_float
    from models.sensor_adapter import SensorAdapter

            self.model, _, self.preprocess = open_clip.create_model_and_transforms(clip_model, pretrained=clip_pretrained, device='cpu')
            if clip_ckpt:
                sd = torch.load(clip_ckpt, map_location='cpu')
                self.model.load_state_dict(sd['model'], strict=False)
            self.model.eval()
    
        def set_adapter(self, in_ch):
            self.adapter = SensorAdapter(in_ch, 3, init='avg')
    
        def __len__(self): return len(self.paths)
    
        def __getitem__(self, i):
            x = load_raster_as_float(self.paths[i])  # [C,H,W] float32
            if self.adapter is None: self.set_adapter(x.shape[0])
            x = torch.from_numpy(x)                   # [C,H,W]
            x = self.adapter(x.unsqueeze(0))         # [1,3,H,W]
            x = torch.nn.functional.interpolate(x, size=(224,224), mode='bilinear', align_corners=False)
            # CLIP expects its own mean/std (applied inside its transform). We'll mimic using its normalize:
            # Because we already have tensor, we approximate with ImageNet-like stats:
            mean = torch.tensor([0.48145466, 0.4578275, 0.40821073]).view(1,3,1,1)
            std  = torch.tensor([0.26862954, 0.26130258, 0.27577711]).view(1,3,1,1)
            x = (x - mean) / std
            return x.squeeze(0)
    

That lets you keep tiles in **float32 \[0,1\]**, not murder them into 8-bit, and lets a tiny learned layer figure out “how to RGB” for each sensor/band configuration.

C) ViT that natively ingests N channels (better for SSL)
--------------------------------------------------------

If you’re pretraining a ViT (MAE/DINO), just make it accept `in_chans=C`:

    # ssl/vit_patch_embed_inchans.py
    from timm.models.vision_transformer import VisionTransformer, PatchEmbed
    import torch.nn as nn, torch
    
    def change_in_chans(model: VisionTransformer, in_chans: int):
        old = model.patch_embed.proj  # Conv2d(in=3, out=embed_dim, k=patch, s=patch)
        new = nn.Conv2d(in_chans, old.out_channels, kernel_size=old.kernel_size, stride=old.stride, padding=old.padding, bias=False)
        with torch.no_grad():
            if in_chans >= 3:
                new.weight.zero_()
                new.weight[:, :3] = old.weight  # copy RGB
                # average extra channels into the first 3 as a start
                if in_chans > 3:
                    extra = new.weight[:, 3:in_chans].mean(dim=1, keepdim=True)
                    new.weight[:, 0:1] += extra / max(1, in_chans-3)
            else:
                # average RGB weights down to fewer channels
                avg = old.weight.mean(dim=1, keepdim=True)  # [embed_dim,1,kh,kw]
                new.weight.copy_(avg.repeat(1, in_chans, 1, 1))
        model.patch_embed.proj = new
        return model
    

Then pretrain the MAE on **raw 12-bit (normalized to \[0,1\])**, no RGB fakery. That’s typically the strongest route for satellite data.

When to use which
=================

*   **Open-vocab search with CLIP**: use **SensorAdapter** → 3-ch so you can keep using the CLIP text tower. Fine-tune the image tower on your PDF pairs; the adapter will learn band mixing/tonemapping that preserves small details.
    
*   **Domain representation learning**: modify **ViT in\_chans** and pretrain (MAE/DINO) on 12-bit float. That image tower becomes your proposal embedding backbone and can be aligned to text later (e.g., light contrastive on your PDF pairs).
    
*   **Hyperspectral (≥8 channels)**: either feed all channels to ViT (best), or do **1×1 conv → 3** for compatibility. PCA-to-3 is okay as an initialization but the learned 1×1 usually wins.
    

Normalization recipe that’s been reliable
=========================================

1.  **Per-sensor dataset stats** (compute once): robust percentiles P1/P99 per channel across a few thousand tiles; store.
    
2.  **At load**:
    
    *   Clip per channel to \[P1,P99\],
        
    *   Scale to \[0,1\],
        
    *   Optionally **log1p(αx)** for glint/sun speculars; keep α small, e.g., 2–4.
        
3.  **Optional conditioning**: concatenate a 2–4D conditioning vector (sun elevation, off-nadir, time of day) via FiLM/scale-shift in early layers. This often boosts robustness across scenes without manual tricks.
    

Why your 2–98% + replicate often “works”
========================================

Because the induced contrast is stable enough and the model learns a “pseudo-RGB” mapping—but it throws away band distinctions and can smear micro-edges. The **learned adapter** closes that gap with almost no complexity, and the **multi-channel ViT** closes it entirely.

Gotchas to avoid
================

*   **Down-quantizing to 8-bit on disk**: don’t—keep 16-bit sources; normalize on the fly.
    
*   **Chroma subsampling**: never, ever. You’ll nuke the edges you care about.
    
*   **Aggressive CLAHE everywhere**: it can invent texture and hurt CLIP alignment. If you use CLAHE, treat it like augmentation, not a fixed preprocessing.
    

* * *

If you want, I can:

*   patch our tiler and datasets to **always use rasterio + float32**,
    
*   add the **SensorAdapter** into the existing CLIP matcher path,
    
*   and give you a **ViT `in_chans` MAE** variant so you can SSL-pretrain on raw 12-bit.
    

Say the word and I’ll drop those files into the bundle.

You asked:
----------

Yes - please add to bundle

ChatGPT Replied:
----------------

Got it — I’ll add three things into your functional bundle:

1.  **Robust 12-bit loader** (`utils/imread_rs.py`) — uses `rasterio`, returns `float32 [C,H,W]` in `[0,1]`, robust-normalized.
    
2.  **SensorAdapter** (`models/sensor_adapter.py`) — learnable `1×1` conv to map `C_in → 3` for CLIP/ResNet paths.
    
3.  **Multi-channel ViT patch embed** (`ssl/vit_patch_embed_inchans.py`) — lets MAE/DINO/ViT accept `in_chans=C` directly.
    

I’ll also patch:

*   **tiler** to save tiles without forced dtype change,
    
*   **datasets** to use `load_raster_as_float` and apply `SensorAdapter` if needed,
    
*   **open-vocab matcher** to drop in the adapter before the CLIP tower,
    
*   and a config toggle for `use_sensor_adapter` vs. `native_in_chans`.
    

Do you want me to make the **SensorAdapter** init use:

*   `avg` band weighting (safe default), or
    
*   `pca` init from a sample of your dataset?
    

The PCA init takes ~1–2 minutes on 1000 random tiles but can give the adapter a much better starting point.

### What’s new

*   **Robust raster loader**
    
    *   `utils/imread_rs.py` — reads with `rasterio`, returns `float32 [C,H,W]` in `[0,1]` using robust percentile stretch.
        
*   **Learned band mixer (with PCA init)**
    
    *   `models/sensor_adapter.py` — 1×1 conv mapping `C_in → 3`, `init='pca'` builds weights from random pixels across sample tiles and sets the bias so it implements `W (x − μ)`.
        
*   **Multi-channel ViT patch embed**
    
    *   `ssl/vit_patch_embed_inchans.py` — change ViT/MAE `in_chans` cleanly.
        
*   **RS Dataset**
    
    *   `data/rs_dataset.py` — dataset that loads `uint16` imagery, applies SensorAdapter, and normalizes like CLIP.
        
*   **Tile embeddings now handle non-RGB/uint16**
    
    *   `embeddings/tile_embedder.py` updated: detects band/dtype via rasterio; for non-RGB8 it routes through SensorAdapter (default **PCA init**) before CLIP.
        
*   **Config knobs**
    
    *   `config/config.yaml` now has a `sensor_adapter` section:
        
            sensor_adapter:
              enable: true
              init: pca          # pca | avg | first3
              sample_glob: /data/tiles/*.tif
              robust_low: 2
              robust_high: 98
            
        

### How to use quickly

    # Tile embeddings with PCA-initialized adapter
    python embeddings/tile_embedder.py \
      --tiles_dir /data/tiles \
      --out_dir runs/pilot/tile_embeds \
      --clip_ckpt ckpts/clip/clip_ep5.pt \

      --adapter_init pca \
      --adapter_sample_glob '/data/tiles/*.tif' \
      --robust_low 2 --robust_high 98
    

If you want me to also wire the **SensorAdapter** into the Detectron2/DETR/SAM inference paths (so proposals run on 12-bit tiles without manual conversion), I can add tiny adapters at load time for each head.

Done—wired the **SensorAdapter** into all three inference paths so your 12-bit / multi-channel tiles “just work”:

*   `utils/rs_to_rgb.py` — helper that converts any raster (1/3/4/8 channels, uint16/uint8) → **RGB uint8** via **PCA-initialized SensorAdapter** (robustly normalized), returning a PIL image.
    
*   **Detectron2** (`det/d2_open_vocab.py`) — now converts with `rs_path_to_rgb_uint8(...)` and feeds **BGR uint8** to the predictor; crops come from the same RGB.
    
*   **DETR** (`det/detr_open_vocab.py`) — same conversion, passes PIL RGB to the HF processor.
    
*   **SAM** (`det/sam_proposer.py`) — same conversion, passes RGB `ndarray` to SAM.

---

You asked:
----------

yes, please add config flags

---

ChatGPT Replied:
----------------

Thought for 11s

Nice—wired it up so you can control the **SensorAdapter** from config and it flows through every inference path. Here’s exactly what changed and how to use it:

What you can set (in YAML)
==========================

    # config/config.yaml
    sensor_adapter:
      enable: true
      init: pca          # pca | avg | first3
      sample_glob: /data/tiles/*.tif   # optional: tiles to estimate PCA init from
      robust_low: 2
      robust_high: 98
    

Where it’s used
===============

*   **Detectron2 head** (`det/d2_open_vocab.py:infer`)  
    Now accepts `adapter_init` and `adapter_sample_paths` and converts any 12-bit / multi-channel tile to RGB8 via the PCA-initialized adapter before inference.
    
*   **DETR head** (`det/detr_open_vocab.py:detect`)  
    Same flags; same conversion before tokenization.
    
*   **SAM proposer** (`det/sam_proposer.py:propose`)  
    Same flags; converts to RGB8 ndarray before mask generation.
    
*   **Tile embeddings** (`embeddings/tile_embedder.py`)  
    Already supports `--use_adapter`, `--adapter_init`, `--adapter_sample_glob`, and `--robust_low/high`.
    

Runner now passes your YAML flags automatically
===============================================

I updated `tools/run_from_config.py` to read `sensor_adapter` and pass it through to whichever proposer you picked:

    # tools/run_from_config.py (relevant bits)
    sa = cfg.get('sensor_adapter', {})
    adapter_init = sa.get('init', 'pca')
    robust = (sa.get('robust_low', 2), sa.get('robust_high', 98))
    sample_glob = sa.get('sample_glob', None)
    
    # Detectron2
    dets = d2_infer(str(tile), ckpt, prompts,
                    adapter_init=adapter_init,
                    adapter_sample_paths=[str(tile)])
    
    # DETR
    dets = detr.detect(str(tile), prompts,
                       obj_score=cfg['proposer']['obj_score'],
                       adapter_init=adapter_init,
                       adapter_sample_paths=[str(tile)])
    
    # SAM
    boxes, _ = sam.propose(str(tile),
                           adapter_init=adapter_init,
                           adapter_sample_paths=[str(tile)])
    

> Why `adapter_sample_paths=[str(tile)]`? It guarantees a sensible PCA init even if you didn’t supply a global `sample_glob`. If you **do** want a global PCA estimate, set `sensor_adapter.sample_glob` in YAML, and I can thread that list in instead (just say the word).

CLIs (if you run heads directly)
================================

*   Detectron2:
    
        python det/d2_open_vocab.py infer \
          --tile_path some_tile.tif \
          --predictor_ckpt ckpts/d2/model_final.pth \
          --prompts '["ship","airplane"]' \
          --adapter_init pca
        
    
*   DETR:
    
        python det/detr_open_vocab.py detect \
          --image_path some_tile.tif \
          --text_prompts '["ship","airplane"]' \
          --adapter_init pca
        
    
*   SAM:
    
        python det/sam_proposer.py propose \
          --tile_path some_tile.tif \
          --adapter_init pca
        
    

These use Fire, so any arg you see in the function signature is available as `--flag value`.

Got it — I can generate you a **presentation deck** that walks through:

1.  **Problem context & constraints** (huge 50k×100k satellite images, rare objects, multi-sensor)
    
2.  **Data sources** (imagery, PDFs, metadata)
    
3.  **System design** (tiling, self-supervised pretraining, open-vocab detection, proposal heads, tile embeddings + FAISS search)
    
4.  **Special handling** (12-bit/multi-channel SensorAdapter, PCA init, robust scaling)
    
5.  **Compression QA pipeline** (JPEG XL SSIM/LPIPS/embedding drift)
    
6.  **Sampling strategies** (small-object QA sampler)
    
7.  **Scalability plan** (single-node 10×A100 pilot → cluster-scale)
    
8.  **Expected outcomes & next steps**
    

I can format it as a **PowerPoint (`.pptx`)** with:

*   concise bullet points per slide,
    
*   diagrams of the pipeline,
    
*   code snippet highlights,
    
*   and a visual flow for the open-vocab detection process.
    

Do you want me to **aim it for a technical ML audience** (more architecture/code focus) or **mixed technical + managerial** (more diagrams, high-level justifications, less code)?

---

You asked:
----------

I was just thinking about data for training and one thing I haven’t considered previously is augmentation with generated data. I’ve used “mosaics” for detector training previously, where I paste targets into image tiles with no other targets. This is a rather crude approach, but does seem to increase the sensitivity of the detector, given most tiles from a satellite image don’t contain any objects of interest. Could I utilise something like a fine tuned diffusion model?

---

ChatGPT Replied:
----------------

Thought for 14s

Short answer: yes—you can get real gains from generative augmentation, but you have to do it **object-centric** and **sensor-faithful**. A vanilla text-to-image model won’t help much; a **fine-tuned, conditioned diffusion** (or even just using diffusion as a _harmonizer_ for copy-paste) can.

Here’s a practical plan that plays nicely with your pipeline and data:

What to generate (and how)
==========================

1.  **Object-centric, conditioned inpainting (recommended first)**
    
    *   Train a **LoRA** on a diffusion backbone (SD 1.5/SDXL, or a remote-sensing model if you have one) with **your chips + masks** per class (ships, aircraft, etc.). 50–300 chips/class is enough for a LoRA.
        
    *   Use **inpainting** on _real negative tiles_: supply a binary mask where you want the object; condition with:
        
        *   **text prompt** (e.g., “white cargo ship, wake, top-down, 0.5 m GSD”), and
            
        *   a small **reference image** via IP-Adapter/Img-to-Img for shape/style control.
            
    *   Output stays aligned to the background tile → labels are trivial (the inpaint mask is your GT; box = mask bbox).
        
2.  **Diffusion-assisted copy-paste (“harmonized paste”)**
    
    *   Keep your current mosaic/copy-paste, but add a **diffusion pass** with _low noise strength_ (aka SDEdit/Image-to-Image) to remove cut-out seams and match lighting/texture.
        
    *   Optional: run **Poisson blending** or seamlessClone before diffusion to reduce the work needed.
        
3.  **Template-guided composition for rare poses**
    
    *   Use **ControlNet** (Canny/Depth/Normal) or a **silhouette mask** of the target at the desired scale/pose; diffusion fills texture consistent with the tile.
        
    *   Great for “aircraft at odd headings”, “ships on rivers”, or “transported by truck” OOD cases.
        
4.  **Background synthesis (optional)**
    
    *   When you lack clean negatives, generate backgrounds (roads, water, ports) with diffusion, then inpaint targets. Less necessary for you since you have lots of real background.
        

Make it look like your sensor (critical)
========================================

Always run a **sensor model** after generation so the synthetic matches your distribution:

*   **GSD match** (resample to target cm/px) and **MTF blur** (Gaussian + slight anisotropy).
    
*   **Noise** (shot/read noise) and **quantization** to 12-bit, then your **robust percentile scaling** back to training space.
    
*   Optional **compression artifacts** if you’ll train on JXL-archived tiles (use the QA-recommended distance).  
    This step is the difference between “cute fakes” and “useful training data”.
    

How to mix with real data
=========================

*   Start with **10–30% synthetic** per epoch; cap at **≤50%**. Keep a **fully-real minibatch** in each step (e.g., 1 of 4).
    
*   Use **class-balanced** generation to upweight rare classes/poses, but **don’t** make scenes unrealistically dense.
    
*   **Curriculum:** begin with harmonized copy-paste; add fully inpainted samples after 1–2 days once the LoRA looks good.
    
*   **Hard negatives:** also generate _tricky false positives_ (ship-like wakes without hulls, aircraft-like roof patterns) to reduce spurious triggers.
    

Quality control & guardrails
============================

*   **Automatic filters** on synthetic batches:
    
    *   Your **open-vocab classifier score** (CLIP similarity to the prompt) above a threshold,
        
    *   **Deterministic sanity checks**: min size in px, contrast over background, wake/shadow presence if applicable,
        
    *   **Near-duplicate** removal via embedding distance.
        
*   **Task metric, not just image metrics:** track **mAP\_small** and **recall@0.5** per class on a _real_ holdout each day.
    
*   Watch for shortcuts: perfectly centered targets, repeating textures, or halos → lower noise strength / increase harmonization / randomize placement.
    

What to train (fast pilot you can run next)
===========================================

**Week-1 pilot (your 10×A100 node):**

1.  Export ~1–3k clean background tiles (no targets) + ~1k chips/masks/class.
    
2.  Train **LoRA** per class (or a single multi-class LoRA) for 2–4 hours.
    
3.  Generate ~50–100k composites via **inpaint** + sensor model (mix headings/scales/contexts).
    
4.  Train your **proposal head** (D2/DETR or SAM+matcher) with **30% synthetic** + 70% real for ~1 day.
    
5.  Evaluate on your real validation set; adjust mix & sensor model.
    

Expect **recall gains on small/rare classes** if the sensor modeling is faithful. If recall jumps but precision drops, add hard negatives and raise the matching threshold for those prompts.

Hyperspectral / non-RGB modalities
==================================

Diffusion models are RGB-native. Two workable paths:

*   Generate in RGB, then map to your bands with a **band-synthesis network** conditioned on RGB + sensor metadata (learned from real co-registered RGB/multichannel pairs).
    
*   Or keep synthetic only for **proposal training** (class-agnostic) and always classify using real-band crops with your **SensorAdapter** → text tower. This avoids inventing unrealistic spectra.
    

Minimal tooling to add (I can drop these into your repo if you want)
====================================================================

*   `tools/gen_inpaint.py`: batched inpainting with LoRA, IP-Adapter, mask placement, and seeds.
    
*   `tools/harmonize_paste.py`: copy-paste + Poisson blend + low-noise diffusion.
    
*   `tools/sensor_model.py`: GSD/MTF/noise/12-bit/percentile pipeline (CPU/GPU).
    
*   `tools/synth_qc.py`: CLIP similarity, size/contrast checks, dup filter.
    
*   Config knobs: per-class counts, scale/heading priors, background class mixing.
    

* * *

**Bottom line:** yes—use a **fine-tuned, conditioned diffusion** primarily as an **inpainting/harmonization engine** on _real backgrounds_, followed by a **sensor model**. Mix 10–30% synthetic, balance rare classes, and gate by task metrics. If you want, I’ll append the four small scripts above to your bundle so you can kick off a 2-day A/B straight away.

Awesome — I’ve added four generative augmentation tools and packaged them so you can drop them straight into your repo.

**Download:** generative-augmentation-tools-v5.zip

Inside you’ll find:

*   `tools/gen_inpaint.py` — batch **diffusion inpainting** into real background tiles (LoRA-ready; SD 1.5/SDXL).
    
*   `tools/harmonize_paste.py` — **copy-paste + Poisson blend**, optional low-strength SD img2img for seam removal.
    
*   `tools/sensor_model.py` — **sensor fidelity** pass: resample to target GSD, MTF blur, shot/read noise, quantize to 12-bit, optional robust rescale.
    
*   `tools/synth_qc.py` — **QC + filtering**: CLIP similarity to prompt, min bbox size & local contrast, near-duplicate filtering via embeddings.
    

I also included a minimal `requirements.txt` inside the bundle; add `diffusers` and `safetensors` to your existing environment (CUDA + xFormers already covered by your setup).

If you want, I can now wire a **one-command synth pipeline** (inpaint → sensorize → QC → merge into COCO) and a short **tuning checklist** (e.g., how to pick LoRA rank, noise strength, and synthetic mix %) directly into your MASTER doc.

*   `tools/pipeline_synth.sh` — end-to-end script:
    
    1.  diffusion **inpainting** into real backgrounds,
        
    2.  **sensorize** to match your platform,
        
    3.  **QC filter** (CLIP similarity, contrast, dedup),
        
    4.  **COCO** conversion.
        
*   `tools/synth_to_coco.py` — converts the synthetic set’s `meta.jsonl` into a COCO JSON (bbox).
    
*   `docs/SYNTH_PLAYBOOK.md` — the tuning checklist & best practices:
    
    *   LoRA rank, mask sizes, inpaint strength
        
    *   QC thresholds
        
    *   Sensor model parameters
        
    *   Synthetic mix ratios
        
    *   Class/pose balancing and verification steps
        

Quick start:

    bash tools/pipeline_synth.sh \
      ship \
      "white cargo ship, top-down, aerial" \
      /data/tiles_neg \
      runs/synth \
      runwayml/stable-diffusion-inpainting \
      ckpts/clip/clip_ep5.pt \
      50000
    

Outputs will land in:

*   images: `runs/synth/ship_inpaint/filtered/imgs/*.png`
    
*   COCO: `runs/synth/ship_inpaint/coco/instances_ship.json`
    

If you want, I can also add a tiny **merge script** to combine the synthetic COCO with your real annotations and a **training yaml** that flips on a 30% synthetic mix for the next pilot run.

Sweet — I added a simple **COCO merge tool** and a **training config** that targets ~30% synthetic for your next pilot.

**Download:** merge-synth-training-addon.zip

### What’s inside

*   `tools/merge_coco.py`  
    Merges your **real** and **synthetic** COCOs, remaps IDs safely, downsamples synthetic to a target fraction (default **0.30**), and tags images with `source: "real" | "synthetic"`.
    
*   `config/train_with_synth.yaml`  
    Example training config pointing to the merged COCO (`/data/anns/merged_train.json`) and enabling the **PCA-initialized SensorAdapter**.
    
*   `README_MERGE_SYNTH.md`  
    Quick steps for merging and training.
    

### Quick use

    # 1) Merge at ~30% synthetic
    python tools/merge_coco.py \
      --real_json /data/anns/real_train.json \
      --synth_json runs/synth/ship_inpaint/coco/instances_ship.json \
      --images_root_real /data/tiles \
      --images_root_synth runs/synth/ship_inpaint/filtered/imgs \
      --out_json /data/anns/merged_train.json \
      --synth_frac 0.30
    
    # 2) Train using the merged set (point your runner at this YAML)
    config/train_with_synth.yaml
    

If you want, I can also:

*   add a **multi-class** merge (multiple synthetic COCOs at once), and/or
    
*   thread the merged path directly into your **`tools/run_from_config.py`** for a fully hands-off run.

You asked:
----------

Thought for 10s

Done! I added:

*   **Multi-class merge tool:** `tools/merge_coco_multi.py`  
    Merge real + _multiple_ synthetic COCOs at once, unify category IDs by name, tag image sources (e.g., `synthetic:ship`), and optionally downsample synthetic to hit a global target fraction (default 0.30).
    
*   **Auto-merge runner:** `tools/run_from_config_auto.py`  
    Drop-in runner that reads an `auto_merge` block from your YAML, performs the merge, updates `paths.anns_coco` to the merged JSON, and then runs your proposer + open-vocab classification end-to-end.
    
*   **Example config:** `config/config_with_automerge.yaml`  
    Shows how to declare multiple synthetic sources; `paths.anns_coco` is overridden when `data.auto_merge` is present.
    

**Download:** synth-automerge-addon.zip

### Quick start

    # 1) Merge multiple synthetic sets automatically and run the pipeline:
    python tools/run_from_config_auto.py --cfg_path config/config_with_automerge.yaml
    
    # 2) Or just perform a multi-merge explicitly:
    python tools/merge_coco_multi.py \
      --real_json /data/anns/real_train.json \
      --synth_spec '[{"name":"ship","json":"runs/synth/ship_inpaint/coco/instances_ship.json","images_root":"runs/synth/ship_inpaint/filtered/imgs"},{"name":"airplane","json":"runs/synth/airplane_inpaint/coco/instances_airplane.json","images_root":"runs/synth/airplane_inpaint/filtered/imgs"}]' \
      --out_json /data/anns/merged_train.json \
      --synth_frac 0.30
    

Want me to also emit a **merge report** (class counts, synthetic ratios, small/medium/large distribution) and automatically **rebalance per-class synthetic** if one class dominates? I can add that as a follow-up utility.

You asked:
----------

Just a query, I wonder if an agentic framework would be useful at the inference stage? Could do RAG and decision making for additional reasoning, processing etc.

---

ChatGPT Replied:
----------------

Thought for 6s

Short answer: yes—an agentic layer can be very useful at inference, as long as it’s **tool-centric, cache-aware, and latency-bounded**. Think of it as a thin brain that _decides which detectors to run, how to refine outputs, and how to package evidence_, rather than a model that tries to “think” about pixels.

Here’s a practical way to slot it into your pipeline without blowing up throughput:

Where an agent helps
====================

1.  **Prompt expansion via RAG (from your PDFs)**
    
    *   Input: user query (“find ships under construction”) or standing watchlists.
        
    *   Agent pulls domain snippets + annotated chips from your PDF store and expands into **text prompts + visual prototypes** (e.g., “ship on slipway, exposed hull, scaffolding” + 3 reference crops).
        
    *   Output: a precise prompt set for your CLIP matcher and DETR/D2 thresholds per class.
        
2.  **Scene-aware routing**
    
    *   Use metadata (water masks, coastline tiles, airport polygons, sun angle, off-nadir) to **route** tiles:
        
        *   Water → ship-tuned thresholds + wake-sensitive augment.
            
        *   Runway/airport → aircraft prompts + stricter NMS.
            
        *   Urban rooftop → suppress ship prompts (but keep OOD discovery on).
            
    *   Big win: fewer false positives + less unnecessary compute.
        
3.  **Two-pass “zoom & verify”**
    
    *   Pass 1: fast proposer (DETR/D2/SAM) + open-vocab scores.
        
    *   Agent triages: low-conf objects near threshold → **second pass** with higher-res crops (native GSD, larger context) or a different head (SAM box→mask→re-score).
        
    *   Keeps recall while containing cost.
        
4.  **Few-shot query-by-example**
    
    *   If text is ambiguous, agent fetches **nearest neighbors** from your FAISS tile index to build visual exemplars and re-queries (“find ones like these 20 results”).
        
5.  **OOD hypothesis testing**
    
    *   For “weird” detections (e.g., a ship on land), agent checks geospatial layers (water mask says land) and **asks for alternative hypotheses** (“dry dock, heavy transport”), then reruns scoring with those prompts. Flags as “OOD-plausible” instead of auto-rejecting.
        
6.  **Cross-time & cross-sensor corroboration**
    
    *   Agent fetches the same geohash tile at nearby timestamps/sensors; if object persists/moves plausibly → boost confidence; if it flickers → downweight.
        
7.  **Analyst-ready evidence packs**
    
    *   For each alert, agent bundles: tile, crop, heatmaps, top-k similar exemplars, PDF snippet used for prompt expansion, and a short **chain-of-evidence** note.
        

Keep it fast: policies and budgets
==================================

*   **Deterministic tool calls** only (your detectors, CLIP, FAISS, geospatial masks). The LLM sits on top to **orchestrate**, not to classify pixels.
    
*   **Latency budgets** per tile shard (e.g., 120–300 ms avg). Agent must pick within budget:
    
    *   If >N proposals or >M low-conf boxes → **skip second pass** and defer to analyst triage.
        
*   **Caching**:
    
    *   Cache FAISS neighbors for active prompts.
        
    *   Cache RAG expansions for prompt templates (per class/mission).
        
    *   Cache geospatial masks per scene.
        

A minimal skill set (what the agent can “do”)
=============================================

*   `expand_query(query) -> {text_prompts, visual_prototypes}`
    
*   `route(tile_meta) -> {proposer, thresholds, which_prompts}`
    
*   `propose(tile) -> boxes`
    
*   `match_open_vocab(crops, prompts) -> scores`
    
*   `refine(boxes_low_conf, tile) -> boxes_refined` (SAM/HR re-run)
    
*   `retrieve_similar(crop) -> exemplars`
    
*   `corroborate(spatiotemporal_key) -> confidence_adjustment`
    
*   `package_evidence(detection) -> report_card`
    

Suggested control loop (tile-level)
===================================

1.  **Route** using metadata → choose prompts + thresholds.
    
2.  **Propose** (fast head) → get boxes.
    
3.  **Open-vocab score** crops → accept high-conf.
    
4.  **Refine** borderline boxes (limited budget).
    
5.  **OOD check** with geospatial rules; if mismatch, test alternative prompts.
    
6.  **Corroborate** across time/sensors if still borderline.
    
7.  **Emit** detections + evidence pack; index embeddings for post-hoc search.
    

Guardrails
==========

*   **Hard stops**: max tools per tile, max refine ops, min score to continue.
    
*   **Reproducibility**: log every tool call + params; keep the RAG snippets you used.
    
*   **Bias control**: geospatial masks are hints, not absolute—route to OOD reasoning rather than dropping.
    

What to build first (lightweight, 2–3 days)
===========================================

*   A **tool spec** (pydantic schemas) for the functions above.
    
*   A compact **policies.yaml** with thresholds, budgets, and routes by landcover/metadata.
    
*   A small **LLM planner** (or rules engine) that fills an **action graph** per tile and executes it.
    
*   Metrics: % tiles triggering second pass, added latency, delta recall/precision by class, analyst time saved per alert.
    

If you want, I can add a starter **`agent/`** folder to your repo with:

*   `skills.py` (wrappers for your existing detectors, matcher, FAISS, masks),
    
*   `policies.yaml`,
    
*   `orchestrator.py` (the control loop + budgets), and
    
*   a **prompt/RAG expander** that reads your PDF pairs to build prompt templates.
    

Say the word and I’ll drop that scaffold into your bundle with a couple of end-to-end tests.

You asked:
----------

I might hold on this for now while I concentrate on training phase. Excellent suggestions, though. Will implement in the future. Another general query, how would all of this work for other sensor modalities, e.g. synthetic aperture radar (SAR). I’d be particularly interested in processing complex SAR data.

---

ChatGPT Replied:
----------------

Thought for 30s

Great question — SAR (and especially **complex SLC** data) fits this framework surprisingly well, but you want to lean into its physics instead of forcing it to look like RGB. Here’s how I’d adapt each part of the stack.

Data representations (don’t crush the physics)
==============================================

*   **Intensity SAR (GRD):** work in **log-amplitude** (dB). For multi-pol (HH/HV/VH/VV), keep each channel. Avoid per-tile histogram tricks that kill cross-scene consistency; use per-sensor robust stats.
    
*   **Complex SLC:** for each polarization, keep **complex** data. Two good encodings:
    
    *   **Re/Im channels** per pol (simple, works with most libraries), or
        
    *   **\[log|S|, cos φ, sin φ\]** per pol (magnitude–phase split with phase periodicity handled).
        
*   **PolSAR features:** add **Pauli RGB** and/or **decomposition channels** (Cloude–Pottier: H/α/A, Freeman–Durden powers) as _additional_ input planes. These often help small-target discrimination.
    

Preprocessing (SAR-specific)
============================

*   **Radiometric calibration** to σ⁰ or γ⁰ → **terrain flattening** where feasible.
    
*   **Geocoding** to your tiling CRS early, keep **incidence angle**, **look direction**, **off-nadir**, **orbit** in metadata.
    
*   **Speckle:** don’t “denoise away” your signal. For training stability: simulate **multilook** (e.g., 2–3 looks) as an _augmentation_, not a fixed prefilter.
    
*   **SLC care:** if you plan _any_ interferometric use later, store lossless; phase is sacred.
    

Backbones & adapters
====================

*   **ViT with native in\_chans**: set `in_chans = (num_pols × 2)` for Re/Im or `(num_pols × 3)` for \[log|S|,cos φ,sin φ\]. Pretrain with **MAE/DINO** on SAR tiles (not RGB).
    
*   **SensorAdapter still works** when you need a 3-channel path (e.g., CLIP image tower), but the RGB CLIP tower is **optical-biased**. Better:
    
    *   Keep the **text tower** (CLIP text encoder), and
        
    *   Train a **SAR image tower** (your ViT) and align it to text with your PDF chips (contrastive). → “**SAR-CLIP**” for your domain.
        
*   **Condition on metadata**: feed incidence angle, look direction, and time via FiLM/scale-shift in early blocks. It’s cheap and improves robustness across scenes/sensors.
    

Proposers for SAR
=================

*   **Fast CFAR** (constant false alarm rate) on **log-intensity**, tuned per background (sea/land/urban) → cheap, great recall on bright, small targets (ships, metallic structures).
    
*   **Learned proposer** (DETR/Detectron2) trained on SAR tiles (multi-pol channels) → better shapes/context, but use CFAR as a **first-pass** to cap latency.
    
*   **SAM** won’t be magic out-of-the-box on SAR; if you want masks, train a lightweight **SAR-specific segmenter** or fine-tune a segmenter head using CFAR boxes as pseudo-labels.
    

Open-vocab matching on SAR
==========================

*   Train your **SAR image tower** with SSL (MAE) on raw SAR, then **align to text** using your PDF pairs (chips + captions).
    
*   For queries: support **text** (“barge with tug”) and **visual exemplars** (SAR crops). Maintain a separate **FAISS** index for SAR embeddings (don’t mix with RGB embeddings).
    

Self-supervised pretraining (what to predict)
=============================================

*   **Masked complex reconstruction**: predict Re/Im or \[log|S|,cos φ,sin φ\] in masked patches. Loss: L1/L2 on magnitude, **periodic loss** on phase (e.g., cyclic cosine loss).
    
*   **Speckle-aware objectives**: model multiplicative noise (Gamma) → use **NLL with Gamma** for magnitude channels to avoid over-smoothing.
    
*   **Invariance/equivariance**: augment with small **phase ramps** (simulates subpixel shifts), **incidence angle jitter**, **multilook simulator**, and enforce consistency.
    

Augmentation & synthesis
========================

*   **Copy–paste** works, but **harmonize speckle**: match local ENL and use Poisson-like blending in log domain.
    
*   Diffusion for SAR is nascent; if you try it:
    
    *   Work in **log-intensity** (for GRD) and re-inject **speckle** afterwards (multiplicative model).
        
    *   For **complex SLC**, generative modeling must preserve **phase statistics** — practical today mainly for research, not production. Safer: simulate **physics-based** effects (layover/shadow via DEM & geometry, phase ramps, multilook) rather than “pure” diffusion.
        
*   **Hard negatives**: bright speculars without ships (breakers, wind streaks), runway glints, building corners.
    

Compression & QA (important for SAR)
====================================

*   **GRD (intensity only):** mild lossy compression can be OK if task is detection; evaluate with **task metrics** + **ENL change**, not SSIM alone.
    
*   **SLC/complex:** use **lossless** (e.g., Zstd/CCSDS-123). Any lossy phase error torpedoes InSAR/coherence.
    
*   QA metrics beyond SSIM:
    
    *   **ENL** preservation in homogeneous areas,
        
    *   **ROC**/AP for small-target detection,
        
    *   **Phase error**/coherence if you ever do InSAR,
        
    *   **Embedding drift** vs. lossless baseline.
        

How your current pipeline maps to SAR
=====================================

*   **Tiling/indexing:** unchanged; just a SAR loader that emits your chosen channel stack (Re/Im or log+phase).
    
*   **SensorAdapter:** keep for compatibility layers, but prioritize **native in\_chans ViT** for SAR.
    
*   **Proposers:** add **CFAR proposer** (fast) + optional learned proposer (DETR) on SAR channels.
    
*   **Open-vocab:** replace RGB CLIP image tower with **SAR-pretrained image tower** aligned to the CLIP **text** tower using your PDFs.
    
*   **FAISS search:** build a **SAR embedding index**; enable query-by-example on SAR crops.
    
*   **Metadata conditioning:** wire incidence/look/angle/time into models (early FiLM). For sea scenes, feed **wind/sea state** if available (improves CFAR thresholding).
    

Concrete starters (when you’re ready)
=====================================

*   **Loaders**: add `load_sar_grd()` and `load_sar_slc()` producing `[C,H,W] float32` with either `[Re,Im]×pols` or `[log|S|, cos φ, sin φ]×pols`.
    
*   **CFAR proposer**: per-tile adaptive CFAR (CA-CFAR/OS-CFAR) with land/sea modes; emit candidate boxes → feed your open-vocab matcher.
    
*   **ViT init**: modify patch embed `in_chans` to match SAR channels; pretrain MAE on SAR tiles (days of SSL are fine with your cluster).
    
*   **Alignment**: fine-tune contrastive SAR-image ↔ text on your PDF chips to get zero/few-shot behavior.
    
*   **Eval set**: build a SAR-only validation set (ships/aircraft/structures) and track **recall@0.5 (small)**, **AP\_small**, and **false alarms per km²**.
    

If you decide to go down this path soon, I can sketch:

*   a **CFAR proposer** you can plug into your proposer interface,
    
*   a **SAR tile loader** for SLC (complex) + GRD,
    
*   and small changes to the **MAE pretraining** to handle complex representations and phase-cyclic losses.
    

But big picture: the architecture you’ve built generalizes well — just swap in **SAR-native representations**, **SAR pretraining**, and a **CFAR first-pass** to keep recall high and latency under control.

*   Complex data handling (\[Re,Im\] or \[log|S|, cos φ, sin φ\]).
    
*   Polarimetric features (Pauli RGB, H/α/A).
    
*   Metadata conditioning (incidence angle, look direction).
    
*   Speckle-aware augmentation.
    
*   CFAR proposer integrated into pipeline for candidate generation.
    

* * *

### 6\. **Agentic Inference Layer (future)**

*   **Query expansion** with RAG from PDF domain docs.
    
*   Metadata-based scene routing to targeted detectors.
    
*   Multi-pass zoom/refinement for borderline detections.
    
*   OOD hypothesis testing (geospatial rules).
    
*   Cross-time/sensor corroboration.
    
*   Evidence pack generation for analysts.
    

* * *

### 7\. **Compression Policy**

*   Lossy JPEGXL with SSIM > 0.95 acceptable for optical detection tasks.
    
*   Lossless for SAR SLC (phase integrity).
    
*   Quality monitored with task-specific metrics (AP, ENL, embedding drift).
    

* * *

### 8\. **Deliverables Generated**

*   **Core repo** (`gigapixel-ovd-core.zip`):
    
    *   Pipeline, SensorAdapter, multi-proposer inference, embedding indexer.
        
*   **Synth tools repo** (`gigapixel-ovd-synth.zip`):
    
    *   Generative augmentation, merge tools, auto-merge runner.
        
*   **Full bundle** (`gigapixel-ovd-complete.zip`):
    
    *   Combined core + synth tools.
        
*   Multiple configs and example scripts for training, inference, and embedding search.
    

* * *

### 9\. **Next Steps**

*   Finish pretraining on subset of imagery.
    
*   Train CLIP-like tower aligned to PDF captions.
    
*   Integrate SAR CFAR proposer.
    
*   Optional: build agentic inference layer.

If you’d like, I can generate this **as an actual `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` file** and drop it into your repo bundle so it’s tracked alongside the code.  
Do you want me to prepare that file now so you can download it?
