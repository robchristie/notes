I'd like to use huggingface transformers in python to run the Gemma 3 27b model. My priority is to enable the "pan and scan" feature for large image handling. I have up to 10 A100 40G GPU's. What settings and techniques can I use to maximise the processing speed?

Love it. Gemma 3-27B **does** have built-in ‚Äúpan & scan‚Äù in ü§ó Transformers‚Äîso you can keep doc diagrams/infographics sharp‚Äîand you‚Äôve got plenty of GPU to push it hard.

TL;DR setup
===========

    from transformers import AutoProcessor, Gemma3ForConditionalGeneration
    import torch
    
    model_id = "google/gemma-3-27b-it"   # or base, as you need
    
    model = Gemma3ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
        model_id,
        torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
        device_map="auto",                       # shards across available GPUs
        attn_implementation="flash_attention_2", # fastest on A100s
    )
    processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, padding_side="left")
    
    # Pan & Scan ON + tuned knobs (see below)
    inputs = processor(
        text=["What does this figure mean?"],
        images=[your_pil_or_tensor_image],
        do_pan_and_scan=True,
        pan_and_scan_min_ratio_to_activate=2.0,     # activate for long/tall docs
        pan_and_scan_max_num_crops=6,               # cap compute
        pan_and_scan_min_crop_size=448,             # avoid tiny, noisy crops
        add_generation_prompt=True,
        return_tensors="pt",
    ).to(model.device)
    
    with torch.inference_mode():
        out = model.generate(
            **inputs,
            max_new_tokens=256,
            temperature=0.2, top_p=0.9, do_sample=False, # fast, low-variance
            use_cache=True,
        )
    print(processor.batch_decode(out, skip_special_tokens=True))
    

*   `do_pan_and_scan=True` is the official switch; Transformers exposes **extra knobs** you can tune for speed/quality trade-offs (see ‚Äúfast image processor‚Äù params below). [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.50.0/en/model_doc/gemma3?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/gemma3/image_processing_gemma3_fast.py?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   Gemma 3 docs call out pan-and-scan explicitly (great for DocVQA / weird aspect ratios). [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.50.0/en/model_doc/gemma3?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/docs/source/en/model_doc/gemma3.md?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[newreleases.io](https://newreleases.io/project/github/huggingface/transformers/release/v4.49.0-Gemma-3?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

Speed levers that actually matter on 10√óA100 40 GB
==================================================

1) Precision & kernels
----------------------

*   **bfloat16** on A100s is the sweet spot: fast and easy. (8-bit can reduce memory but usually isn‚Äôt faster for inference on A100s.)
    
*   Use **FlashAttention 2**: `attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"` when loading. (Supported across modern Transformers via the attention interface.) [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/attention_interface?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
    *   If you don‚Äôt see a speedup, validate your FA2 install and note some older model versions ignored the flag; current Gemma-3 docs show it working. [Markaicode](https://markaicode.com/transformers-flash-attention-implementation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/35153?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
        
*   Enable TF32 matmul (helps some ops):
    
        torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32 = True
        torch.set_float32_matmul_precision("high")
        
    

2) Shard the 27B model across GPUs (for **latency**) or run many replicas (for **throughput**)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   With bf16, weights are ~54 GB; a **2-GPU** shard (2√ó40 GB) is a nice latency/complexity balance.
    
*   Let **Accelerate** do the work: `device_map="auto"` (or use `load_checkpoint_and_dispatch` for explicit per-GPU memory caps). [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/usage_guides/big_modeling?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
*   For **maximum QPS**, don‚Äôt spread one model over all 10 GPUs; instead spin up **5 replicas** (2 GPUs each) behind a simple router. That avoids cross-GPU latency overhead while using all cards. (If you must go wider, 3‚Äì4-way sharding is usually the knee of the curve; 8‚Äì10-way rarely helps for a single request.)
    

3) Make pan-and-scan fast
-------------------------

Pan-and-scan boosts quality by sending extra **crops** through the frozen SigLIP encoder; it also adds compute. Use the ‚Äúfast‚Äù image processor args (they‚Äôre in the Gemma 3 processor) to control the crop explosion:

*   `pan_and_scan_min_ratio_to_activate`: raise this (e.g., **2.0‚Äì2.5**) so normal photos skip crops; long receipts/infographics still trigger.
    
*   `pan_and_scan_max_num_crops`: cap at **4‚Äì6** for speed; bump to 8‚Äì10 only for gnarly docs.
    
*   `pan_and_scan_min_crop_size`: keep **‚â•448** so tiny crops don‚Äôt waste tokens.  
    These options are exposed in the Gemma 3 image processor implementation. [GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/gemma3/image_processing_gemma3_fast.py?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

**Push preprocessing onto GPU:** the Gemma 3 fast processor accepts **`torch.Tensor` images**; if you pass CUDA tensors, the resizing/cropping happens on-GPU, avoiding a Python/PIL bottleneck. [GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/gemma3/image_processing_gemma3_fast.py?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

4) Batch & concurrency
----------------------

*   **Micro-batch images**: group requests with similar crop counts to avoid stragglers.
    
*   Prefer **greedy** (or small-temperature) decoding, **no beams**, and set realistic `max_new_tokens`. That keeps KV-cache small and fast.
    
*   For multi-image prompts, consider lower `pan_and_scan_max_num_crops` per image to control quadratic growth in tokens.
    

5) Long context & KV cache
--------------------------

*   Gemma 3 supports **128K** context, but KV grows with output length. Keep prompts tight; use single-shot Q&A vs. long chats when you can. (Gemma 3‚Äôs architecture mixes local + global attention to tame KV a bit, but you can still blow cache with long generations.) [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19786v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    

6) Optional knobs (when you need to fit on fewer GPUs)
------------------------------------------------------

*   **4-bit/8-bit** loading (`bitsandbytes`) can cram the 27B onto a single A100 40 GB, but **latency usually worsens** vs. bf16 on 2 GPUs. Only use it to free GPUs for replicas.
    
*   **torch.compile** can help a little for steady-state serving (try `mode="reduce-overhead"`), but measure; FA2 already does the heavy lifting.
    

Practical presets
=================

### A. ‚ÄúBalanced latency‚Äù (2√óA100 shard)

*   Load bf16, FA2, `device_map="auto"`.
    
*   Pan-and-scan: `min_ratio_to_activate=2.0`, `max_num_crops=6`, `min_crop_size=448`.
    
*   Greedy decoding, `max_new_tokens=256`.
    

### B. ‚ÄúDoc-centric quality‚Äù

*   Same as above, but `max_num_crops=10`, `min_ratio_to_activate=1.6`.
    
*   Expect ~1.4‚Äì2√ó slower per request on dense infographics.
    

### C. ‚ÄúMax throughput on 10 GPUs‚Äù

*   Run **five** identical 2-GPU shards behind a simple HTTP router; batch by request size.
    
*   Keep pan-and-scan conservative: `max_num_crops=4`, `min_ratio_to_activate=2.5`.

*   Technical report + write-ups confirm Gemma 3 uses a **SigLIP 400M** vision encoder and **pan-and-scan** for non-square/high-res images‚Äîso your gains will show up most on documents, receipts, charts, etc. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.19786v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[deepranking.ai](https://deepranking.ai/llm-models/gemma-3-27b?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

If you want, I can throw together a tiny launcher that spins up **N** shards, runs a quick latency/QPS sweep with different pan-and-scan settings on a few sample docs, and prints the curves‚Äîthen you can lock in the preset that hits your speed/quality goal.

Awesome ‚Äî I built you a small, runnable benchmark ‚Äúlauncher‚Äù that sweeps pan-and-scan settings and reports latency/throughput.

*   **Download everything**:  
    gemma3\_launcher folder
    
    *   `bench.py` (CLI runner)
        
    *   `prompts.txt` (sample prompts)
        
    *   `requirements.txt`
        
    *   `README.md` (step-by-step use)
        

Quick start (after you copy to your GPU box):

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    huggingface-cli login  # if needed for the model
    
    python bench.py \
      --model_id google/gemma-3-27b-it \
      --precision bf16 \
      --attn_impl flash_attention_2 \
      --device_map auto \
      --images "/path/to/docs/*.png" \
      --prompts prompts.txt \
      --num_samples 40 \
      --batch_size 2 \
      --max_new_tokens 256 \
      --grid_min_ratio 2.0,2.5 \
      --grid_max_crops 4,6 \
      --grid_min_crop_size 448 \
      --output_dir runs
    

It will:

*   Load Gemma 3-27B with **bf16 + FlashAttention-2** and `device_map=auto`
    
*   Sweep pan-and-scan knobs (min ratio / max crops / min crop size)
    
*   Run batched requests over your images + prompts
    
*   Write one **CSV per sweep** with `p50/p95` latency, **req/s**, and approx **tokens/s**
    

Throughput on **10√óA100**: run **five replicas** (2 GPUs each) in parallel for best QPS (details/instructions in README). If you want me to tailor the grid or add an HTTP router + simple load generator, say the word and I‚Äôll extend it.

Ah, that‚Äôs on me‚Äîfolder links can be flaky. I‚Äôve packaged everything into a single ZIP and added direct file links too.

*   **One-click ZIP:** gemma3\_launcher.zip
    
*   Or grab files individually:
    
    *   bench.py
        
    *   prompts.txt
        
    *   requirements.txt
        
    *   README.md
        

You don‚Äôt need any special access‚Äîjust download and run on your GPU box. If the links still don‚Äôt open, I can paste the code inline or push it to a Git gist for you.
